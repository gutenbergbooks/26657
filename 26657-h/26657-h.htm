<h2>THE MOTOR PIRATE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>MAINLY ABOUT MYSELF</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Of</span> course every one has heard of the Motor Pirate. No
one indeed could help doing so unless he or she, as the
case may be, happened to be in some part of the world
where newspapers never penetrate; since for months his
doings were the theme of every gossip in the country,
and his exploits have filled columns of every newspaper
from the moment of his first appearance until the day
when the reign of terror he had inaugurated upon the
roads ended as suddenly and as sensationally as it had
begun. Who the owner of the pirate car was? Whence
he came? Whither he went? These are questions
which have exercised minds innumerable; but though
there have been nearly as many theories propounded as
there were brains at work propounding them, so far no
informed account of the man or his methods has been
made public.</div>

<p>Nearly twelve months have now elapsed since he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
last heard of, and already a number of myths have grown
up about his mysterious personality. For instance, it
is not true, as I saw asserted in a sensational evening
paper the other day, that the Motor Pirate was in the
habit of abducting every young and attractive woman
who happened to be travelling in any of the cars he held
up. On only one occasion did he abduct a lady, and
in that case there were special circumstances with which
the public have never been made acquainted. His deeds
were quite black enough without further blackening with
printer's ink, and it would be a pity if the real Motor
Pirate were lost sight of in mythical haze such as has
gathered about the name of his great prototype, Dick
Turpin.</p>

<p>It has occurred to me, therefore, to tell the story of his
doings&mdash;it would be impossible for any mortal man to
give an absolutely detailed account of his life and
actions&mdash;but I know more than the majority of people about
the personality of the man. Of one thing my readers
may be assured: I personally can vouch for the accuracy
of every fact which I chronicle. You see I am not a
professional historian.</p>

<p>How it happened that I am in a position to give
hitherto unknown particulars about the Motor Pirate
will appear in the course of my narrative. Sufficient for
the moment let it be for me to say that it was purely by
chance that the opportunity was thrown in my way;
though, as it happened, it was not entirely without my own
volition that I became involved in the network of events<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which finally resulted in the tragedy which closed his
career. By that tragedy the world lost a brilliant thinker
and inventor, though unfortunately these great talents
were accompanied by an abnormal condition of mind,
which led the owner to utilise his invention in criminal
pursuits.</p>

<p>It may probably seem strange that, being in possession
of facts as to the identity of this mysterious person, I did
not lay them before the police, who, at any time during
the three months of his criminal career, would have given
their ears to lay him by the heels. You may even think
it is their duty to take proceedings against me as an
accomplice. Well, I am quite prepared to answer any
question which the police, or any one else for that matter,
desires to put to me. James Sutgrove, of Sutgrove Hall,
Norfolk, is not likely to change his address. When my
poor old governor died he left me sufficient excuse, in the
shape of real estate, for remaining in the country of my
birth; though, if the necessity had arisen, I should not
have hesitated about going abroad. At twenty-five, my
age within a few weeks, a man has usually sufficient
energy to enable him to carve out a career for himself
in a new country, and I do not think I am very different
to my fellows in that respect. But the fact is, I have
nothing to fear from the police. My criminality was
less than theirs. An ordinary citizen may be forgiven
if he is blind to the meaning of things which occur under
his nose, but the police are expected to be possessed of
somewhat sharper vision. The utmost that can be urged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
against me is, that if my eyes had been keener than those
of Scotland Yard, reinforced by the trained vision of
some hundreds of intelligent chief constables throughout
the country, I might have been able to lay my hands
upon the Motor Pirate before&mdash;but I must not anticipate
my story.</p>

<p>One word of apology, however, before I begin. In
order to make my narrative fully intelligible I shall have
to refer to matters which may seem of a purely personal
nature. I will make these as brief as possible, but it
was entirely through such that I was brought into closer
touch with the Motor Pirate than, perhaps with one
exception, any other person in the world. If therefore
I seem to be devoting too much attention to what appears
to be merely personal interest, I trust I may be excused.
To begin, then, at the beginning.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the evening of March 31, 19&mdash;, I had arranged
to dine in town with a couple of friends, both of them
neighbours of mine. I am not going to mention the
name of the restaurant. It was not one of the fashionable
ones, or probably neither the cuisine nor the wines
would have been so good as they were, though both
would unquestionably have been more expensive. I
prefer, therefore, to keep the name to myself. It was
in the neighbourhood of Soho, however, and the reason
I had invited my friends was in order to disabuse their
minds of the idea that everything in that neighbourhood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>was of necessity cheap and nasty. I had determined
that their palates should be charmed by the dinner they
were to eat, so, in addition to sending a note to the
proprietor, I thought it as well to arrive at the restaurant
a quarter of an hour before the appointed time, in order
to make assurance doubly sure that everything was as
I desired it. Had my guests been casual acquaintances,
I must confess that I should never have taken this
trouble. But they were not. One of them was the
renowned Colonel Maitland. I never heard anything
about his war service, but I do know that as a
gastronomist his reputation is European. The cool way
he will condemn an <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, presented to him by an
obsequious waiter, merely after casting a single glance
upon it, speaks volumes for his critical insight; and as
for wines&mdash;well, he can tell the vineyard and the vintage
of a claret by the scent alone. I verily believe that
were he to be served with a corked wine, the result
would be instant dissolution between his gastronomic
soul and body. Naturally I had to make some preparations,
in order that such delicate susceptibilities should
not be offended. In addition, I had a special reason for
seeking to please him. Colonel Maitland had a daughter.</p>

<p>I have only to mention the name of my other guest
to reveal his identity to every one with any knowledge
of the motoring world. It was Fred Winter, <i>the</i> Fred
Winter, leading light of the Automobile Club, holder
of more road records than I can count, in fact the most
enthusiastic motorist in the country. It was in consequence
of this, indeed, that he came to be my guest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
There were few questions in regard to motoring upon
which Winter was not competent to give an opinion,
and being myself a victim to the prevailing motor-mania,
I was deeply indebted to him for many valuable tips.
By this time I had passed my novitiate, and was still
driving a neat little 9&frac12;-h.p. Cl&eacute;ment in order to fit
myself for a more powerful and speedy car.</p>

<p>I arrived then at the restaurant about a quarter to
eight, and having had a brief but satisfactory interview
with the proprietor, I made my way to the table I had
reserved in my favourite corner of the dining-room.
Finding I had ten minutes to spare, to kill time I ordered
a vermouth and the evening papers. The <i>Globe</i> was the
first upon the pile the waiter brought to me, and following
the example of most sane men, I skipped the parliamentary
intelligence and turned to the "By the Way"
column. I remember distinctly there was only one
amusing paragraph therein, and I was about to throw
the paper aside, with the customary lament as to the
decadence of British humour, when my attention was
arrested by a paragraph at the bottom of the next column.
The heading was "Strange Highway Robbery." This
was the paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our Plymouth correspondent reports a novel highway
robbery on the road between Tavistock and Plymouth.
Two gentlemen who had been for a run on
their motor to Tavistock, left the latter town about eight
o'clock last night. Their journey was uneventful until
they reached Roborough, where they were suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
overtaken by a motor-car occupied by a man, who presented
a pistol at their heads, and ordered them to stop.
Thinking that the stranger merely intended to scare
them, and that the summons was only an ill-advised
piece of pleasantry, they paid no attention to the demand;
whereupon the driver of the strange car, with a well-directed
shot, so damaged the machinery of their vehicle
that they were compelled to obey. Their attacker then
demanded all the money and articles of value they had
in their possession under threat of completely wrecking
their car, and after securing his booty the highwayman
decamped. In consequence of the damage to their motor,
it was not until late at night that they reached Plymouth,
and were enabled to give particulars of the occurrence
to the police. From their description of the stranger's
vehicle, identification should not be difficult. It is a
long, low, boat-shaped car of remarkable speed, and from
the little noise it creates is probably driven by an electric
motor. As to the personal appearance of the driver, the
gentlemen who were robbed could form no opinion, for
he wore the usual leather coat affected by tourists, and
his head was completely enveloped in a hood."</p>

<p>On reading this paragraph, my first impulse was to
lay aside the paper and indulge in a hearty laugh. My
impression was that some wag had been hoaxing either
the Plymouth correspondent or the London editor of the
<i>Globe</i>. However, my curiosity was sufficiently aroused
to lead me to take up another paper, to see if the <i>Globe</i>
was the only paper which reported the occurrence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The next paper on my pile was the <i>Star</i>, and the
moment I unfolded the pink sheet, I perceived that this
liveliest of evening journals was not going to be left
behind by the <i>Globe</i> in providing the public with particulars
of the latest sensation. Under the heading of
"A Motor Pirate," with descriptive headlines extending
across a couple of columns, and as attractively alliterative
as the cunning pen of a smart sub-editor could make
them, was the account of a similar incident. At first
I thought it must be the same occurrence, but a brief
perusal showed me that this impression was a wrong one.
But I will give the <i>Star</i> account in full, and I do so the
more readily, not only because it contains the first detailed
account of the man whose extraordinary audacity was
shortly to raise the interest of the public to fever pitch,
but also because it tells the story with a force and colour
of which my unpractised pen is incapable. Apologising
therefore to the editor for the liberty I have taken, I
reprint the <i>Star</i> account verbatim. I think, however,
the story deserves a new chapter.</p>

real existence. On arriving at Salisbury I at once proceeded
to make inquiries as to what was known of the
outrage, but Salisbury generally was sceptical on the
subject. I found, however, that the affair had been
reported at the county police office; and I at once drove
on here, and am now in a position to assert that this quiet
Wiltshire village has been the scene of the most astounding
robbery of modern times. It is safe to prophecy that in
a few more months Dick Turpin will be forgotten. He
has a rival in the field whose exploits will soon relegate
him into comparative obscurity.</p>

<p>"The first visible evidence of the outrage was afforded
me about a quarter of a mile from Compton. The road
dips here slightly, and at the end of the incline a motor-car
was drawn to the side of the road, or rather the
remains of what had once been a smart Daimler of some
7 or 8 h.p. A stonebreaker was at work on an adjacent
pile of flints, and when I alighted to examine the wreck,
he nailed me with, 'Hoy, mister! Ye'd better leave
thick thur car alone. The p'lice be comin' to tek un up
zhortly.'</p>

<p>"I gathered from him that he had been told to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
an eye upon the car, but beyond having heard that the
owners had met with an accident, he knew nothing.
There was no doubt about the accident. The car was
so broken up that it looked as if it had been in collision
with an armoured train.</p>

<div class='right'>
"Compton Chamberlain, 2.45 p.m.<br />
</div>

<p>"I have just succeeded in interviewing the owner of
the motor-car, a Mr. James Bradshaw, of 379, Maida
Vale. His companion was Mr. Gainsborough Roberts,
of 200, Clapham Common. Mr. Roberts is suffering
from severe concussion, and has not regained consciousness;
but fortunately Mr. Bradshaw's injuries, though
painful, are not dangerous, and he has been good enough
to give me a full account of his unique adventure. It
seems the two gentlemen had been touring in the west
country for ten days, and were on their way home.
They stopped the previous night at Exeter, leaving about
ten in the morning with the intention of reaching Salisbury
about five or six yesterday evening. They lunched
at Ilminster, and afterwards had traversed another twenty-five
miles of their journey when one of their tyres
unfortunately punctured. This was shortly after they
had passed through Wincanton. When the tyre was
mended, something went wrong with the electric ignition,
and altogether the repairs proved such a tedious job that
they could not make a fresh start until close upon lighting-up
time.</p>

<p>"The delay had not troubled them, for the weather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was beautifully fine. As, however, they were very
hungry, they determined to stop at Shaftesbury for dinner
before finishing the day's run they had mapped out.
There is a particularly long hill into Shaftesbury, and
they did not reach that town until 8.30. At the hotel
they met another party of motorists, and, agreeing to dine
together, it was not until after ten that they found themselves
once more on their way, with twenty miles of a
hilly road to cover. The lateness of the hour did not
trouble them much. They had wired to Salisbury for
rooms; the night was fine and clear; a bright moon was
shining; the roads were clear of traffic, and their motor
was guaranteed to do its thirty-five miles an hour. They
thought that it would be a good opportunity to find out
what Mr. Bradshaw's car was really capable of doing on
a hilly track.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradshaw declares that he had never enjoyed a
run more than he did on this occasion. A brisk wind
was blowing behind them, they found there was more
downhill than up, the road was absolutely clear, and they
were able to take the declines at a pace which took the
sting out of the ascents."</p>

<p>"So for twenty minutes they ran at full speed, and
after slowing to pass through a village, they had just put
on full speed again when Mr. Bradshaw's attention was
arrested by a curious humming sound which appeared to
arise from something behind. He was, of course, unable
to glance back, as all his faculties were engaged in driving
the car; but Mr. Roberts, whose attention was attracted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
at the same moment, informed him that another motor-car
was coming up behind. Then, to quote Mr. Bradshaw's
own words, 'Thinking the other chap was on for
a race, I did everything I knew to get every ounce out of
my motor. But,' he continued, 'though I'll swear we
were running nearer forty than thirty-five, the other
fellow swooped up and passed us as if we were standing
still.'</p>

<p>"For the moment he thought that the stranger was
one of those American speed motors specially built for
racing on the track, but only for a moment. The strange
car slackening speed, allowed them to come alongside.
What followed may be best described in Mr. Bradshaw's
own words.</p>

<p>"'There was only one occupant of the strange car,
and, seeing him slacken speed, I naturally thought he
wished to speak to us. So, as he came level, I shouted
to him, my exact words being, if I remember aright,
"Hallo, sir! You've got a flyer there." I fancied I
heard a chuckle from beneath his mask (he wore a hood
covering the head fitted with a mica plate in front) and
he replied, "Yes; I fancy my car is fast enough to
overtake anything that is to be found on the road."
There was something in his tone that struck me as
peculiar, but I merely attributed it to the motorist's pride
in his car. As however he said nothing further, but
continued to keep alongside, in a manner that looked
as if he were inclined to gloat over the owner of a less
speedy machine, I asked with some little irritation, "Is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
there anything I can do for you, because if not&mdash;&mdash;"
He did not allow me to finish my query. "Yes, sir,"
he replied promptly, "there is something I am going to
ask you to do for me," and he gave another of his infernal
chuckles.</p>

<p>"'"Well, what is it?" I demanded, with a little
warmth.</p>

<p>"'"I must request you to hand over all your money
and valuables to me," he replied.</p>

<p>"'I could not believe my ears. I was so astonished
that I gave the wheel a turn that nearly landed us in
the ditch. Will you believe it? Even in that swerve
the strange car followed mine, and when I had got her
straight in the road, I heard him chuckle again. His
manner angered me beyond bearing.</p>

<p>"'"What the deuce do you mean?" I shouted.</p>

<p>"'"There's no need for you to lose your temper,"
he answered coolly. "I must, however, trouble you to
stop that car at once."</p>

<p>"'As he spoke he raised his hand, and I saw the barrel
of a revolver glisten in the moonlight. There seemed
to be only one way out of the predicament, for I thought
I had to deal with a madman, and I took it. I pretended
to be so alarmed that I fell over the steering wheel, and
made my car swerve again. But this time we swerved
towards, instead of away from, the stranger. I doubt
whether there was light enough for him to have read
my intention in my face, but it was obvious that he
anticipated my move, for his car shot forward with such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
wonderful speed that the fate I intended to force upon
him befell myself. I saw his car disappearing ahead,
and the next moment I was just conscious of a shock
that sent me flying into oblivion.</p>

<p>"'Exactly how long I remained unconscious I do not
know, but when I came to my senses I found myself
lying on the grass at the roadside, having fortunately
been thrown on the soft turf. Roberts was lying unconscious
on the road; the car was smashed to bits; our
pockets had been turned inside out, and our money,
watches, and every article of value we had about us,
taken. Needless to say, the stranger had disappeared.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradshaw was not in a state to be of much
assistance to his more badly injured friend, and he was
at a complete loss as to what course to pursue, when a
trap coming from Salisbury fortunately made its appearance
on the scene. Assistance was procured, and the
two injured gentlemen were conveyed to Compton, and
medical attention quickly provided. Though much
shaken, and badly bruised, Mr. Bradshaw has sustained
comparatively little injury. Mr. Roberts, however, is
dangerously ill, and his relatives have been telegraphed for.</p>

<p>"As regards the appearance of his assailant, Mr.
Bradshaw can give few particulars, save that he was clad
in a large leather motoring coat, and his face completely
hidden by a mask. The car can, on the contrary, be
easily identified. It is boat-shaped, running to a sharp,
cutting edge both in front and behind. The body is
not raised more than eighteen inches from the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
The wheels are either within the body, or so sheathed
that they are completely hidden. It has apparently
seating accommodation for two persons, the seat being
placed immediately in the centre of the car. Mr. Bradshaw
is quite convinced that petrol is not the motive
force used for its propulsion, and as he cannot imagine
that an electric motor of any kind was employed; the
rapidity of motion, the perfection of the steering, the
absence of noise and vibration, are so remarkable that
he is utterly at a loss as to what build of car was driven
by the stranger."</p>

<p>I had just finished reading this extraordinary story
when I felt a tap on the shoulder, and, looking up, saw
Colonel Maitland standing before me.</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, Sutgrove," he remarked, "I have
never before seen any one so completely enthralled in
a newspaper in my life. I've been standing watching
you for nearly a minute."</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, and held out my hand.</p>

<p>"What's the latest from Mr. Justice Jeune's division?
When you come to my years of discretion you will be
more interested in the <i>menu</i>."</p>

<p>I laughed. "It was not the inanities of the divorce
court, Colonel," I remarked; "but the most astonishing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked me with uplifted hand. "Being a
rational being," he said, "I prefer my stories with my
cigar. One should come to dinner with a calm mind."</p>

<p>At this moment Winter entered the room, and, giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a signal to the waiter, the <i>hors d'&#339;uvre</i> were placed before
us as he seated himself at the table.</p>

<p>When he had greeted me I had observed that Colonel
Maitland's face had worn a slightly resigned expression
that reminded me of a picture I had seen somewhere
of Christian martyrs being led to the stake. He took
a mouthful of caviar and the cloud lifted. After the
soup the dominant note of self-sacrifice had vanished
entirely. With the fish his features attained repose.
When we reached the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> his face had the radiance
of a translated saint's. Then, with my mind at rest as
to the effect of my little dinner upon my chief guest, I
found time to devote a little attention to Winter. Yet,
bearing in mind the Colonel's objection to anything but
light generalities during the serious business of dinner,
I forbore to introduce the topic I was burning to discuss
with him. Not until the coffee was upon the table, and
Colonel Maitland had expressed his contentment with
the dinner, did I venture to refer to it. Then, while
our senior was dallying with an early strawberry, Winter
gave me a lead.</p>

<p>"By the way, Sutgrove," he said, "what's this I saw
on the evening paper bills about a motor pirate?"</p>

<p>I told him. His interest was awakened to such an
extent that he forgot to taste the glass of port which
stood before him, and which I had ordered out of compliment
to the Colonel's ideas of what was desirable.</p>

<p>When my story was concluded Winter was silent.
Colonel Maitland, however, hazarded the remark that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the whole narrative was "a concoction of some of those
newspaper fellows. I have been at the War Office," he
said, "so I ought to know of what they are capable."</p>

<p>"I can scarcely imagine that any newspaper would
dare hoax its readers to such an extent," remarked
Winter.</p>

<p>"They are capable of anything&mdash;anything," replied
the Colonel, vigorously. "I have known them on more
than one occasion to attack even my department."</p>

<p>"That of course is scandalous," I replied warmly;
"but here the conditions are different. They are referring
to people who are able to reply if the facts are not as
stated. In your case your mouth, of course, was closed."</p>

<p>"Umph!" growled the Colonel.</p>

<p>"At the same time," said Winter, "it may very well
have happened that consciously or unconsciously the
papers have been made the victims of a practical joke.
To-morrow is the first of April, remember. Or even
apart from the joke theory, the event happened after
dinner, and Mr. Bradshaw may have found it necessary
to be prepared with an explanation of his accident."</p>

<p>"But the robbery?" I objected.</p>

<p>"A passing tramp may have thought the opportunity
too good to be neglected."</p>

<p>"At all events," I persisted, "it is curious that two
similar accidents should have occurred the same night in
the same part of the country."</p>

<p>"Certainly the coincidence is remarkable," answered
Winter. "But do not forget that the two occurrences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
took place at least a hundred and thirty miles apart within
less than three hours of one another. I will swear that
no motor yet built would cover those roads inside three
hours. I know them. No, Sutgrove. The moral
seems to me to be that it is unwise for a motorman to
look upon the wine when it is red, if he wants to get
anywhere afterwards."</p>

<p>The Colonel stretched his hand across the table and
removed the glass which stood on the table before
Winter.</p>

<p>"My young friend," he observed, "you have, I
believe, undertaken to bring me safely home to-night?"</p>

<p>"You need not fear," replied Winter, laughing, "it's
only the liquors supplied at country inns which drive
motor-cars into ditches."</p>

<p>The Colonel replaced the glass with a smile and
refilled his own from the cradled bottle at his elbow.</p>

<p>"I am merely a passenger, but you drive," he remarked.
"I think, Sutgrove, under the circumstances,
I will be responsible for the remainder of this bottle. It
is endowed with certain qualities which particularly
recommend themselves to me. It would be a sad thing
if an accident were to befall us on our journey. In times
of stress such as these one never knows when the War
Office may not require the services of a capable man."</p>

<p>Though the Colonel spoke in jest, in the event his
words indicated with a fair amount of accuracy the
destination of the port, for while we continued to discuss
every point in the story, he sipped and sipped and nodded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his head beatifically. I did not replenish my glass, but
when we rose the bottle was empty.</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel, what do you say to a music hall?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"My boy," he replied, as he patted me on the back,
"I sleep far more comfortably in my bed."</p>

<p>I realized where the contents of the bottle had gone
by the sententiousness of my friend's phrasing, the slight
turgidity, so to speak, of his articulation.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," he continued, "I have never known
you until this moment. You are greater than Columbus.
Any one might discover a new continent, but in these
days it needs exceptional qualities of enterprise and
endurance to discover a fresh restaurant. I am content.
Let us go home."</p>

<p>We donned our overcoats and came into the open
air. Winter's motor was waiting at the door in charge
of a man from the <i>garage</i> where he had left it. We
stepped in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>WHEREIN I MEET THE PIRATE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>We</span> were soon out of the narrow Soho street, and I
observed that the time was just half-past ten as Winter
steered us carefully through Piccadilly Circus. Colonel
Maitland occupied a seat behind while I sat beside
Winter.</div>

<p>The car my friend drove was a magnificent 22-horse
Daimler, built to his own specification and capable of
doing considerably more than any car I had hitherto
been privileged to ride upon. Of course while passing
through the streets there was little chance of exhibiting its
capabilities. Yet even there, the way the car glided in
and out of the traffic, delicately responsive to the slightest
touch of the steering wheel, was sufficient evidence of
its quality to set the most nervous passenger at ease. As
it was as yet too early for the after theatre traffic to fill
the streets and compel us to stop every few minutes, we
followed the main road up Oxford Street as far as the
Marble Arch. There we turned to the right. Once
clear of the narrow part of the Edgeware Road, Winter
put on his second speed and a very few minutes seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to have passed before we were bumping over a rough bit
of roadway by Cricklewood.</p>

<p>"There's not much of this," said Winter, cheerily
over his shoulder to the Colonel.</p>

<p>Our gastronomic friend merely grunted for reply, and
I should have thought him to be asleep had not the red
glow of his cigar assured me that he was still awake.</p>

<p>Winter jammed on his third speed and the hedges
began to fly past us. We were in the country now and
were able to appreciate the fineness of the night. Indeed
it was a perfect night. The air was sharp but without
sting. The moon shone with a clear brilliance which
betokened rain in the near future. The road was clean
and dry, and there was no dust in the air except the thin
cloud which floated behind us. We passed the Welsh
Harp without a check, and not until we reached Edgeware
did Winter revert to his second speed. We ran through
the little town with only momentary slackening of pace,
and so we sped onwards until we opened the stretch of
road leading to Brockley Hill. Here Winter, seeing the
road clear ahead, jammed on his highest speed and the
wheels droned like a hive of bees as we darted towards
the incline. We were half way up the hill before
Winter found it necessary to transform his speed into
power, and we finished the ascent with ease. Then
once more the order was third speed, and we whirled
away through Elstree and passed through Radlett a bare
half hour from the time we started.</p>

<p>Just at this time I looked back to see how Colonel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Maitland fared. His cigar no longer glowed, though it
was still tightly held between his teeth. His head was
bent forward, and the regular and gentle murmur which
came from his nose proclaimed that he slept. I had just
mentioned the fact to Winter, and had turned again to
assure myself that he was comfortably wrapped in his
rug, when I thought I saw on the road behind me
another car.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" I said to Winter. "There's another chap
coming on behind us. Without lights, too!"</p>

<p>A slight bend in the road shut out the view, however,
and made me doubt whether or no my eyes had been
deceiving me.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" replied Winter. "We've passed nothing
on the road, and at the pace we've been travelling there's
not another car owned in this district we should not
have left miles behind us, even if it had started at the
same time as ourselves. You must have mistaken some
of the shadows from the trees. How much of that port
did you drink?"</p>

<p>I laughed, but as we had now reached a straight
stretch of road I looked back again.</p>

<p>"I'm right," I said. "There is another car, and by
jove! It's coming up hand over fist."</p>

<p>"What?" shouted Winter. "What?"</p>

<p>He clearly did not appreciate the idea of being overtaken
by any one, for he whipped on his highest speed
and jammed down the accelerator. The change was
enormous. Our powerful car, relieved from all restraint,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
simply leaped through the air. Winter gave a pleased
laugh as he steadied her with the wheel.</p>

<p>"If the stranger can catch us now I shall believe it's
the Motor Pirate himself," he remarked in a pleased
tone, that showed how proud he was of his own car.</p>

<p>Our progress was so exhilarating that I wanted to
shout defiance to the stranger; yet I was so fascinated
with the pace we were travelling, that I could not take
my eyes from the road which uncoiled before us.</p>

<p>Suddenly a humming sound forced itself upon my
ear. For a moment I thought it was due to the whirr
of our own wheels. Then it struck me that the note
was a higher one. I half turned. The other car was
within a yard or two of us. In another second it was
level and, running without any visible vibration, indeed,
without any noise save the snore of the wheels as they
raced round, the stranger slackened speed and ran by
our side.</p>

<p>Winter cast a hasty glance at the strange car, and
I saw him bite his lip with annoyance at finding his
Daimler so outpaced.</p>

<p>One glance at the stranger was enough to tell me
with whom we had to deal. In the brilliant moonlight,
the boat-shaped car with its sharp prow, the almost
invisible wheels, the masked occupant, assured me that
the evening papers <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'has'">had</ins> not been the victims of a
hoax.</p>

<p>"It's the Motor Pirate himself," I said to Winter,
and my voice was hoarse with excitement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Motor Pirate be d&mdash;&mdash;d!" replied Winter. What
more he would have said I do not know, for at this
moment the stranger turning his mask towards us called
out in the most urbane manner&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must trouble you gentlemen to stop that car."</p>

<p>Winter at the best of times is of rather a peppery
disposition, and whenever any one requires him to pull
up, his temper invariably gets the better of his manners.
His reply was an unnecessarily verbose, and needlessly
forcible negative.</p>

<p>I heard the stranger chuckle. "I really must trouble
you to obey my wishes," he replied, with ironic courtesy.
"Otherwise I shall be compelled to do some damage to
that car of yours, a proceeding I always try to avoid if
possible."</p>

<p>"Do what you please," was in effect Winter's luridly
adjectived answer.</p>

<p>"If you do not pull up within thirty seconds your
fate will be upon your own heads," said the stranger,
shortly, as he laid his hand upon a lever.</p>

<p>His car leapt away from ours, and though we were
running nearly sixty miles an hour, we might have been
standing still, he dropped us so rapidly. In fifteen
seconds he had vanished in a cloud of dust ahead.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stop," said Winter, abruptly. He
suited the action to the word, and none too soon.</p>

<p>Again we heard the curious drone of the strange car
as it swooped down upon us, coming to a sudden halt a
yard distant, with really beautiful precision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want?" shouted Winter, in his
gruffest tones.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to find you have had the wisdom to do as
I desired you," said the Motor Pirate; for it was indeed
he with whom we were now face to face. "It would
have deeply grieved me to wreck so good a car as that
you have there. A Daimler, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, d&mdash;&mdash;n your compliments! What is it you
want?" growled Winter.</p>

<p>"Merely any articles of jewellery and any money you
may happen to have about you," remarked the stranger,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>I saw the moonlight glitter on the barrel of a revolver
as he spoke, and he now lifted the weapon and
pointed it towards us.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to proceed to extremities, and, as I
gather from your speech that I am dealing with gentlemen"&mdash;really
Winter's language had fully warranted
the sarcasm&mdash;"if you will give me your word of honour
that you will hand over to me all articles of value in
your possession, I will leave your car untouched. If, on
the contrary, you decline to oblige me, I shall be under
the disagreeable necessity of ruining that very handsome
car you are driving. I do not like to hurry you, but I
am afraid I must ask you to come to a speedy decision
on the matter, for these roads in the vicinity of London
are not quite so secluded as one of my profession could
wish."</p>

<p>He delivered this speech with an air of mock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
politeness, which made Winter writhe. He did not,
however, reply. I think he was too angry.</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen! Make up your minds. Your
money or your&mdash;car!"</p>

<p>He made a slight pause before he said the word
"car," and his fingers played with the revolver in a
manner that sent a cold shiver down my spine.</p>

<p>"It's his turn now," I whispered to Winter. "It may
be ours presently."</p>

<p>"Come, come, gentlemen!" said the stranger again;
"do you give me your words?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;n you! I suppose we must," jerked out
Winter, almost inarticulate with rage.</p>

<p>"Each of you will dismount in turn and lay the
contents of your pockets before me here." He indicated
a level shelf, which formed apparently part of the casing
of one of the wheels. "I must insist upon seeing the
linings of your pockets; and I need hardly warn you that
it will be extremely undesirable for you to make any
movement liable to misconstruction. This toy"&mdash;he
lifted his pistol&mdash;"has a very delicate touch. Now,
gentlemen. One at a time, please, and do not wait to
discuss the question of precedence. I am quite willing
to overlook any little informality."</p>

<p>I listened closely to his speech, but the voice was so
muffled by the mask he wore, that I felt I should be
unable to recognize it again. Only one point I was
assured upon&mdash;that the Pirate was an educated man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile what were we to do? All sorts of wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
plans were darting through my brain, and I knew that
Winter's mind must be equally active. But out of the
medley no coherent scheme took shape. Winter dismounted,
and, throwing off his overcoat, advanced into
the brilliant circle of light cast by our lamps, and proceeded
to empty his pockets. He laid his note-case, his
watch and chain, and sovereign-purse upon the car in
front of the highwayman, and, in obedience to a further
command, added the diamond which shone upon his
little finger, and another which adorned his shirt-front,
to the pile. Then he resumed his place in the car, and
I passed through a similar humiliating ordeal. All the
while the stranger kept up a flow of apologies for the
inconvenience which his necessities compelled him to
occasion us. I kept silence, though I must confess the
effort was a considerable strain upon my temper. Still,
a pistol with a business man at the butt end of it, is of
considerable assistance in preventing the exhibition of
annoyance.</p>

<p>"If the other gentleman will make haste, I shall be
the sooner able to relieve you of my unwelcome society,"
the Pirate remarked, as I returned to our car after
handing over all the valuables in my possession.</p>

<p>In the excitement, I had, until this moment, entirely
forgotten the presence of Colonel Maitland; and now,
looking closely at him, I discovered that he was still in
happy ignorance of the <i>contretemps</i> which had befallen
us. Swathed in rugs, he was propped up on the seat
behind us slumbering peacefully. A smile was upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rosy face, and ever and again he smacked his lips. He
must have been dreaming of a finer vintage than ever
terrestrial vineyard produced.</p>

<p>"What the deuce can we do?" I asked Winter.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Colonel!" shouted my friend.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired the Pirate. "Does
your friend refuse to acknowledge the compact?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he can hardly be said to be a party to
it," I replied. "He has dined, and now he sleeps."</p>

<p>"Well, you will awaken him less roughly than I
shall," was the retort.</p>

<p>"Any one who knows Colonel Maitland is aware
that he is exceedingly annoyed if awakened from his
after-dinner nap," I urged.</p>

<p>"Colonel Maitland? Colonel Maitland the
gourmet?"</p>

<p>"You know him?" said Winter.</p>

<p>The Pirate laughed pleasantly. "I have met him
on one occasion, and, as some slight return for a very
excellent dinner which he ordered, and for which&mdash;doubtless
by an oversight&mdash;he left me to pay, I will not trouble
you to awaken him on this occasion. I wish you good
evening, gentlemen."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking he backed his car for a few
yards. His hand moved to a lever. The car turned.
He waved the hand which was disengaged, and in a
moment he was gone, attaining at once a speed, which,
until then I had thought it impossible for a motor-car
ever to achieve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Both Winter and I sat stock still, gazing after the
fast disappearing car. We could not watch it for long;
as in fifteen seconds it was out of sight, and even the
dust-cloud it had raised in its progress had cleared.</p>

<p>Then Winter turned to me and muttered a few
expletives gently in my ear. I followed his example
and we both felt better, at least I think so; for, without
rhyme or reason, Winter burst into a fit of laughter,
and I followed his example, though I cannot explain
now, any more than I could have done then, why I
laughed.</p>

<p>When we had done laughing, Winter turned to me
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sutgrove, old fellow, would you mind punching
me? I'm not quite sure whether it is the Colonel who
is asleep or myself. I feel as if I have just awakened
from dreaming of the story those newspapers printed."</p>

<p>"It's not much of a dream," I remarked. "I little
thought that we were to have the good fortune of so
early an introduction to the Motor Pirate, however. The
Colonel will be quite cross to think that his bottle of
port prevented the renewal of an old acquaintance."</p>

<p>Then Winter laughed again. I think he saw the
amusing side of our adventure more clearly than I did,
for I said sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better be getting on to St. Albans, and
giving information to the police?"</p>

<p>"H&mdash;m&mdash;m!" he answered meditatively. "I think
perhaps we had better not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not?" I replied in surprise.</p>

<p>"In the first place it is after dinner," he said.</p>

<p>"What of that? We dined wisely."</p>

<p>"One of us knows nothing about it." Winter jerked
his thumb in the direction of the slumbering warrior.
"We could hardly explain the reason why the Colonel
slept so soundly through the adventure. The explanation
could hardly please him, would it?"</p>

<p>I muttered an assent.</p>

<p>"Besides," continued Winter, "for three of us to
admit that we tamely allowed ourselves to be held up
by one man, and forced to hand over to him all our
valuables, well it&mdash;er&mdash;it hardly seems heroic, does it?
That wouldn't create a very favourable impression upon
Miss Maitland either."</p>

<p>I was compelled to agree with him.</p>

<p>"I think perhaps we had best keep the matter to
ourselves. I have no desire to provide another sensation
for the evening papers to-morrow."</p>

<p>"At any rate I'm not going to sit down quietly
under my loss if you are," I responded irritably.</p>

<p>"That's another matter altogether," replied Winter,
as he set our car in motion once more. "I did not say
that I was going to grin and bear it either."</p>

<p>"What do you propose?" I cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"That is a question we will discuss over a whisky
and soda, when we have deposited the Colonel safely at
home;" and he refused to say anything further.</p>

<p>Our car was once more put at full speed, and in five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
minutes we reached the cross-roads on the outskirts of
St. Albans, where the road to Watford makes a junction
with that on which we had come from town. Here
Winter pulled up, and, much to my surprise, dismounted
and made a careful examination of the road by the light
of our lamps.</p>

<p>"I just want to see in which direction the fellow
went," he answered, in reply to my inquiry as to the
meaning of his action.</p>

<p>He was still engaged on the task when we heard in
the distance the regular beat of a petrol motor approaching
us on the Watford road.</p>

<p>"If it's another pirate, he won't get much plunder,"
I remarked.</p>

<p>"That's no pirate," replied Winter, as a couple of
lights came into view. "Cannot you recognize the
rattle of Mannering's old car? I should know it anywhere.
He will be able to tell us if any one has passed
him on the road."</p>

<p>As soon as the new-comer came within range of his
voice, Winter hailed him.</p>

<p>"That you, Mannering?"</p>

<p>"Hullo, Winter! Got a puncture? Can I be of
any assistance?"</p>

<p>Was it indeed Mannering's voice, or were my ears
deceiving me? The intonation was remarkably like
that of the stranger, who so short a time previously had
bade us stand and deliver, that I sprang to my feet with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>an exclamation of astonishment. My eyes at once
convinced me that my ears had played me false. There
was no mistaking Mannering's lumbering old car for the
graceful shape of the Motor Pirate's vehicle. I resumed
my seat, taking my nerves seriously to task for generating
the suspicion, if suspicion it could be called, which had
flashed across my mind. If anything further had been
needed to dispel it, the reply vouchsafed to Winter's
query as to whether he had met any one on the road
would have done so.</p>

<p>"Met any one?" said Mannering; "I should think
I have. Met the most wonderful motor I've ever seen,
about a couple of miles back. 'Pon my soul, I'm not
sure even now whether it was not a big night bird, for
it just swooped by me with about as much noise as a
humming-top might make. It must have been travelling
eighty miles an hour at least. Reckless sort of devil the
driver must be too. He hadn't a single light. I suppose
his lamps must have been put out by the rapidity with
which he was travelling. Never had such a scare in my
life. I'd like to meet the Johnny. I'd welcome an opportunity
of telling him what I thought of his conduct."</p>

<p>"So should I," replied Winter, grimly; "and I fancy
Sutgrove would not be averse to a meeting with him."</p>

<p>"Why, what has he been doing?" asked Mannering.</p>

<p>"It's too long a story to tell you now," said Winter,
as he climbed back into his seat; "but if you will come
up to my place as soon as you have put your car to bed,
I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"Right!" sang out Mannering, as we once more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
set out upon our homeward way. We had not much
further to go. In two minutes we had pulled up at
Colonel Maitland's door.</p>

<p>I leaned back and shouted, "Here we are, Colonel,"
in the slumbering warrior's ear.</p>

<p>"Eh! What&mdash;what?" he replied, as he awakened
with a start. "When are we going to start?"</p>

<p>"Start? Why we've brought you safely home to
your own threshold," said Winter.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul! I remember now," he answered.
"I just shut my eyes to keep the dust out of 'em,
and&mdash;&mdash; You will come in for a peg, of course," he
continued, as he emerged from the rugs in which he had
been enveloped.</p>

<p>I glanced at the windows. There was only a light
in the Colonel's study. If there had been another in
the drawing-room, I should have accepted forthwith. As
it was, I merely said that I could not think of disturbing
Miss Maitland.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the Colonel, with the usual callous
disregard of the mere father for his children's beauty
sleep.</p>

<p>But he did not press the invitation. Indeed it was
with difficulty he succeeded in repressing a yawn.</p>

<p>"I'll call to-morrow, and get a considered opinion
upon my Soho house of entertainment," I remarked, as
the Colonel opened his door, and paused at the entrance
to bid us a final good night.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," he replied, as he grasped my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
hand and shook it warmly. "But of one thing you
may rest assured. So long as that bin of port holds out,
your house of entertainment may count upon me as a
regular customer whenever I dine in town."</p>

<p>"Opium isn't in it," commented Winter in a low
voice, as he set the car in motion and wheeled out of the
drive. "How he could have slept so soundly through it
all absolutely beats me."</p>

<p>I did not reply. My attention was concentrated
upon one of the upper windows, at which I thought I
had seen a form I knew very well make a brief appearance.
But we left the window and house behind us.
Winter's place was only about a hundred yards further
up the road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CONCERNING MY RIVAL</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Now</span>, Jim, dip your beak into that, and let me see if it
will not restore to your classic features their customary
repose."</div>

<p>So saying, Winter handed me a stately tumbler, and
the mixture was so much to my liking that I felt an
involuntary relaxation of my facial muscles immediately I
obeyed the command. I stretched myself at length in
the easy chair which I had drawn up before the fire, and
felt able to forgive even the Motor Pirate. We
were alone in the apartment which Winter called his
study, but since the only books he read therein were
motor-catalogues, and the lounges with which the
snuggery was furnished were much more conducive to
repose than to mental exertion, I refused to acknowledge
its claim to the title. That, by the way. The fire was
burning brightly. Winter's red, rugged, honest face was
beaming with almost equal radiance. Who could help
feeling happy?</p>

<p>Then Mannering was announced, and Mannering was
a man I had learned to passively dislike. Why, I scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
knew. I was aware of nothing against him. Indeed,
when six months previously, on my first coming to St.
Albans, I had been introduced to him, I had been rather
favourably impressed. He was a tall dark man of thirty-five,
with more than the average endowment of good
looks. He could tell a good story, had shot big game in
most parts of the world, was well-read, intelligent,
possessed unexceptionable manners, and yet&mdash;&mdash; Well,
Winter had none of his various qualifications, but I
would at any time far rather have had one friend like
Winter than a hundred like the other man.</p>

<p>I had first made his acquaintance at Colonel Maitland's
house, where I had found him on an apparently intimate
footing. Perhaps it was this very intimacy which formed
the basis for my dislike, for&mdash;there is no need to mince
matters&mdash;at this time I was jealous, horribly and unreasonably
jealous, of every male person who entered the
Colonel's house. And here, perhaps, it will be better
for me to explain how it happened that I came to be
living in a cottage on the outskirts of St. Albans in
preference to my own house in Norfolk.</p>

<p>The change in my residence had been entirely due to
a tennis party at Cromer. There I met Evie Maitland.
She was&mdash;&mdash; No, every one can fill in the blank from
their own experience for themselves; and if they cannot,
I pity them.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had an aunt present. She was the most
amiable of aunts, and quite devoted towards her most
dutiful nephew. With her assistance, I managed not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
only to improve my acquaintance with Miss Maitland,
but also to effect an introduction to her father. I had
only known them a week, however, before the Colonel
took his daughter back to St. Albans. I allowed an
interval of a fortnight to elapse, and then I followed. Of
course I had to be prepared with some excuse, and here
luck favoured me. Looking through the directory I
discovered that Winter, whom I knew slightly as having
been up at Camford about the same time as myself, was
also a resident in the delightful St. Alban's suburb of
St. Stephens where the Maitlands resided. I sought
out Winter. I confided my story to him. The upshot
of it all was that I took a cottage close to his house, and
not far from the Colonel's, ostensibly that under Winter's
tuition I might develop into a first-class motorist.</p>

<p>Somehow I found that I made a great deal more
progress with my motoring than with my love-making.
Surely a more bewitching, tantalizing, provoking little
beauty than Evie Maitland never tore a man's heart to
fragments. If she was kind to me one day, she would be
still kinder to Mannering the next. But that is neither
here nor there. Anyhow, I heartily wished him out of
the way, for there was no doubt whatever that Randolph
Mannering was a much more attractive person than my
insignificant self. His mere advantage in age counted
for something; but I could have forgiven him that, had
he not made use of the years to see so much and do so
much, that he could not help appearing in the light of a
hero to a girl who was just at the worshipping age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
And he knew so well how to get the fullest value out of
his experiences. He never paraded them, I must admit
that much in his favour. He was far too clever. An
anecdote here and there to illustrate some point in
the conversation, a modest account of some thrilling
adventure, in which he hardly ever mentioned the part
he had personally played, produced a much greater effect
than if he had gone about trumpeting the deeds he had
done and the dangers he had survived.</p>

<p>He had, too, the advantage of a much longer acquaintance
with the Maitlands than myself. I learned from
the Colonel that Mannering had been living in a house
whose garden adjoined his own for a year before my
arrival on the scene. His life, until the Colonel had
recognized him as an acquaintance he had made at the
house of a friend some years before, had been that of
a recluse, the object of his retirement being to perfect
some mechanical invention upon which he was engaged.
He had soon developed into a friend of the family, and
I had found him firmly installed as such when I made
my appearance at St. Albans.</p>

<p>Naturally then I was none too pleased that Winter
had proposed to take him into our confidence, but I
made no absolute objection.</p>

<p>I sat smoking quietly while Winter told the story of
our adventure. He listened most attentively.</p>

<p>"It's a most extraordinary story," he remarked, when
the narrative was concluded. "You are quite sure
neither of you touched any of that port?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Winter turned one of his pockets inside out with an
expressive gesture.</p>

<p>"Wine may rob a man of his wits," he replied, "but
it does not relieve him of fifty pounds in notes, six in
gold, a watch and chain worth fifty, and a diamond
which has been valued at a hundred."</p>

<p>"The numbers of the notes should enable you to
trace the thief," said Mannering, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Winter laughed. "The fact is, I am such a careless
beggar. I always carry notes about with me, replenishing
my case when necessary; and really I have nothing
to tell me whether those notes I had in my possession
were the last batch I had from the bank, or odd ones
left over from previous consignments. They may have
been in my case for months."</p>

<p>"Both Winter and I could identify our watches,"
I hazarded.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Mannering, "if your Motor
Pirate is fool enough to attempt to pawn them you may
get the chance; but if he sells them to a receiver, they'll
go straight into the melting pot."</p>

<p>Winter lit a cigarette and Mannering turned to me.
"What was the extent of your loss?"</p>

<p>"Ten in gold, thirty in notes, and say thirty for my
watch. My loss is comparatively light."</p>

<p>"You know the numbers of your notes, I suppose?"
he inquired, as he lit a cigarette in turn.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I'm not quite so casual as
Winter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's some clue for the police to work upon,
then."</p>

<p>"It might prove to be so, only Winter thinks we
show up so badly in the whole affair that he won't hear
of my giving information."</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Winter, "Maitland slept soundly
through the whole affair, and it wouldn't be sporting to
give him away."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;&mdash;" began Mannering.</p>

<p>Winter deftly changed the subject. "What puzzles
me," he said, "is the kind of motor the fellow employed
to propel his car. I know of nothing at present on the
market anything like so effective. I've seen 'em all."</p>

<p>"Your loss doesn't seem to trouble you much,
anyhow," commented Mannering.</p>

<p>"I would willingly give a hundred times as much
for a duplicate of that motor. I should be pretty sure
to get my money back once I put it on the market."</p>

<p>"If there's all that value in it, why should the owner
go in for highway robbery?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's just what I fail to understand," said Winter.
"From what I could see of it, our friend the Motor
Pirate is possessed of an ideal car, graceful in shape,
making no noise, running with a minimum of vibration
and a maximum of speed. Why, there's a fortune in it."</p>

<p>"Of course it is quite impossible that the motive
power can be electricity?" remarked Mannering, gazing
into the fire as if he could see a solution of the mystery
therein.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite out of the question. Any one who has the
slightest knowledge of motoring would know it to be
impossible, even if the Pirate had devised a storage
battery which would knock Edison's latest invention
into a cocked hat. But supposing he had achieved the
feat, remember that, according to the newspaper reports,
he was at Plymouth yesterday at dusk, near Salisbury
at eleven the same evening, and holding us up on the
confines of St. Albans to night. He would be bound to
get his batteries recharged somewhere and, with a car of
such remarkable shape, how is he to do so without
exciting remark? No; electricity is quite out or the
question. I should be glad to think that the car was
an electric one. His capture would only be a matter of
a few hours."</p>

<p>An indefinable expression, which might have been a
smile, flitted across Mannering's face.</p>

<p>"I hope, for all our sakes, his motor is an electric
one," he said. "At all events it should not be difficult
to track a car of so singular a shape. If it were built on
the same lines as yours or mine, for instance, the owner
might go anywhere without attracting attention."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," I broke in, "until he is captured I'm
going for a run every night with something that will
shoot within easy reach. The next time I have the
fortune to meet with him I hope I shall be in a position
to get a bit of my own back."</p>

<p>Again a smile appeared on Mannering's face as he
exclaimed, "I almost feel inclined to follow your example.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I have nearly forgotten how to use a pistol since I have
resided in this law-ridden land."</p>

<p>"Surely you won't expose your experimental car to
the chance of being rammed by the Motor Pirate,"
remarked Winter, chaffingly.</p>

<p>Mannering's car was a stock joke with us. It was a
particularly cumbersome vehicle, with heaven only knows
what type of body. It might have been capable of
twenty miles an hour on the flat, but that would be the
extreme limit of its powers. "You fellows," he had
explained to us one day, "have taken to motoring for
the fun of flying along the high-roads at an illegal speed.
I have taken to it for a more utilitarian purpose. I have
my own ideas about the motor of the future, and I am
working them out down here. My old caravan is heavy,
perhaps, but I want a heavy car. It's most useful for
testing tyres, and that is one of the special points engaging
my attention. Besides, in this car I am not tempted to
get into trouble with the police. Twelve miles an hour
is quite fast enough for all my purposes."</p>

<p>Both Winter and myself had frequently asked him
how he was progressing with his work, but as he had
never returned us any but the vaguest of answers, nor
ever invited us into the workshop which had once formed
the stables of the house where he resided, we had thought
that his story of being engaged in mechanical invention
merely an excuse for getting rid of unpleasant visitors.
I think we were both surprised when he answered
Winter's chaff quite warmly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should not at all mind exposing my car to any
risk if I could get the opportunity to examine the Motor
Pirate's car. If the truth must be told, from what
I have seen of his car, and what you have told me, I am
rather inclined to think that whoever designed it has
forestalled me in an idea which I had thought quite my
own. I have long been working to produce a car which
would run at least a hundred miles an hour without
noise or perceptible vibration."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you get it completed in a week?" interrupted
Winter. "We might have a most exciting chase
after our friend."</p>

<p>Mannering shook his head. "I've been absolutely
floored on one detail, and if that fellow has solved the
problem&mdash;&mdash;" Shrugging his shoulders, he rose and
held out his hand to Winter. I followed his example.</p>

<p>"I had no idea that you had anything so important
on the stocks," remarked Winter, as he accompanied us
to the door.</p>

<p>"Nor would you have done so until you saw the
perfect machine on the road, if it had not been for my
chagrin at seeing that car to-night. Of course I can
count upon you both to say nothing of the matter."</p>

<p>"On condition that you do not refer to our adventure
again," said I, laughing.</p>

<p>"Agreed," responded Mannering, as he smiled
again.</p>

<p>We both said good night to Winter, and in spite of
our host's efforts to persuade us to stay for another peg, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
followed Mannering out, declaring that I should never
be able to face Mrs. Winter again if I kept him up any
longer.</p>

<p>I found Mannering standing at the gate, and I paused
beside him to glance at the sky, across which one or two
fleecy clouds were hurrying from the west. The moon,
brilliant as earlier in the evening, now hung low down
over the horizon. The breeze had freshened, and we
could hear it whispering amongst the trees.</p>

<p>"We shall not be long without rain. If the Pirate
is still abroad he will leave tracks," said Mannering.</p>

<p>The beauty of the night held so much of appeal to
me that I felt annoyed at the current of my thoughts
being turned back to the topic.</p>

<p>I answered shortly. My companion took no notice
of my petulance.</p>

<p>"You have always thought I cared nothing for
speed," he remarked, "but you were mistaken. I thought
I would keep my desires in the background until I had
succeeded in perfecting a car which I knew it would be
impossible to outpace. I could not enter into competition
with longer purses than my own, and if I had bought the
fastest car in the market somebody else would have
bought one faster. But to-night&mdash;&mdash; By Jove! How I
envy that Motor Pirate. Imagine what the possession of
that car means on a night like this, with the roads clear
from John-o'-Groat's to Land's End. Fancy flying
onwards at a speed none have ever attempted. Can you
not see the road unwinding before you like a reel of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
white ribbon, hear the sweet musical drone of the wheels
in your ears&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>He must have observed my natural amazement at the
intensity of feeling which his speech displayed, for he
observed in a lighter tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not being Motor Pirates, however, the next best
thing is, I suppose, to go to bed and dream that we are."
He turned on his heel and strode away in one direction,
while I went in the direction of my own home. But I
was in no hurry to get there. The night was too
delightful.</p>

<p>In the few hours which had elapsed since we had sat
down to dine, a change had come over the face of the
land. I could feel the presence of Spring in the air, and
all the youth in me awoke. The creatures of the earth
felt it too. In the silence of the night I could hear the
crackle of the buds as they cast off their winter coverings,
hear the whisper of the grass, which the countryman
declares is the sound of growing blades, hear the murmur
of all animate things as they rose to welcome the Springtide.
My own heart leapt up with a renewal of hope.
I stood awhile outside Colonel Maitland's door, and
breathed a prayer that it might be my fortune to protect
the fair inmate of the house from all harm through
life. I strolled slowly to my own door, but I did not
enter. Moonbeams beget love-dreams when one is still
in the twenties.</p>

<p>Back again to the Colonel's house, back once more
to my own. In all probability I should have continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
my solitary sentry-go and my reverie until daybreak,
had not my thoughts been sharply recalled to earth.
On reaching my own doorway for the fifth or sixth
time I had just turned, when I saw a black shadow
on the road opposite the Maitlands' house. One glance
was enough; it was the Motor Pirate again, and I
began to count. "One&mdash;two&mdash;," the car passed me,
"three&mdash;four;" it had vanished round a turning of
the road in the direction of St. Albans.</p>

<p>Even what I had already experienced of the Pirate
had not prepared me for such an exhibition as this.
What Mannering had said about the delight of flying
along an open road at a hundred miles an hour recurred
to me. I had not deemed it possible. But I paced
the distance between the Colonel's house and the bend
where the strange car had passed out of sight. The
distance was just about two hundred yards, and it had
been covered as near as possible in four seconds. The
car must have been travelling just about a hundred
miles an hour.</p>

<p>I went straight indoors to bed. I am not ashamed
to confess that I was not able to continue my dreams
in comfort, while pacing the road, by the consideration
of what would have happened to me had the Motor
Pirate come along just two seconds before I happened
to turn and see him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE COLONEL DREAMS, AND I AWAKEN</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">I slept</span> until late the next morning. I have always
been accustomed to a clear eight hours' sleep, and, as I
did not get between the sheets until about four in the
morning, I naturally did not awaken until mid-day. So
what with my tub and the necessity for shaving, my early
morning call upon the Colonel did not come off. I
suppose, as a matter of fact, I sat down to breakfast just
about the time when the gastronomic warrior was
thinking of luncheon. However, when I saw how
amply my expectation of a change in the weather had
been fulfilled, I did not regret my lengthy sleep. From
a sodden grey sky sheets of water were steadily pouring.
There was not the slightest chance of any break in the
clouds. Consequently I felt assured of finding Miss
Maitland at home if I made my call in the afternoon, and
since her father oftentimes thought it expedient to take
a little repose after luncheon in order to prepare himself
for the fatigue of dining, it was possible that I might
even be fortunate enough to secure a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
her.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>I came to my breakfast, therefore, with as good a spirit
as appetite, neither being in the slightest degree affected
by the memory of the easy way in which I had been
plundered by the Motor Pirate. Of course I felt a
certain chagrin. Still, I could contemplate the adventure
with a considerable deal more equanimity than I had
managed to display the night before, though I found
that my curiosity concerning him had, if anything,
increased. I turned with eagerness to the morning
papers to see whether they could add to my knowledge
concerning him.</p>

<p>As every one is aware, all the papers on the morning
of the first of April that year devoted columns to his
exploits. If I remember aright, the country was at that
time engaged upon two of our usual minor wars, Parliament
was in the midst of an important debate upon the
second reading of a measure to secure an extension of
the franchise, and a divorce case of more than common
interest was engaging the attention of the leading legal
lights of the law courts. But all these things received
but the scantiest notice. The war news was relegated to
the inside pages, the Parliamentary intelligence cut down
to the barest summary, the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> dismissed with
such a paragraph as ordinarily serves to chronicle an
unimportant police court case. The Motor Pirate had
nearly a monopoly of the space at the editorial disposal.
There was column after column about him. The
Plymouth robbery was reported in as great detail as the
Compton Chamberlain affair, while there were particulars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of two similar outrages committed at points between
these two places.</p>

<p>On running my eye over the reports I saw that they
added nothing to what I already knew, and I wasted no
time in reading the leaders on the subject. I was, however,
extremely interested to find from one paper that
Winter and I had not been the only victims of the
scoundrel's rapacity on the previous evening, for a brief
telegram reported a similar occurrence a few miles from
Oxford on the London road. I at once sent my man
to purchase any of the early editions of the evening
papers which might have reached St. Albans, in the
hope that they might contain further particulars of these
operations.</p>

<p>I had finished my breakfast, and was enjoying a
cigarette in my library, when he returned. I took
the papers from him, and the first glance at one of
them made me gasp with amazement. The news
which startled me was all in one line&mdash;"Five more
cars held up by the Motor Pirate."</p>

<p>I am not going into details concerning these. If
you have a desire to refresh your memory all you have
to do is to turn to any newspaper of the date I have
named and you will be able to get them <i>ad nauseam</i>.
But I will venture to give a list of the places where and
the times at which the outrages took place, for I made
a list of them in the hope that, by carefully studying it
with the map, I might get some idea as to where he
might next be expected to make his appearance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>I found that at five minutes past nine he stopped
a car some four miles from Oxford. Twenty minutes
later he was robbing a lonely motorist midway between
Thame and Aylesbury. Then for forty minutes he
appeared to have been idle, his next two exploits taking
place within five minutes of each other, just after ten,
in the neighbourhood of Amersham. King's Langley
was the scene of his next adventure, the time given
being about a quarter of an hour before he had overtaken
us. In addition to the particulars of these robberies
there were a host of reports from people who had seen
the Pirate car pass them on the road. But there was one
notable omission from the latter list. Not from a single
town was there any record of the Pirate having been
seen passing through it.</p>

<p>I got a map of the district, and, after studying the
country carefully, I was fain to confess that one of two
things was certain: either the Motor Pirate had the power
to make his car invisible at will, or else he had a truly
phenomenal knowledge of the bye-roads. How he had
even managed to get to Oxford, after his exploits in the
West of England, without arrest, puzzled me. The
car was so unique in shape that it seemed bound to
excite observation. It could not have been put up at
any hotel, any more than it could have been run through
the country by daylight, without exciting remark and
its presence being chronicled. What, then, had he done
with it? The more I pondered the question the more
puzzled I became, and at the same time the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
determined to seek a solution of the mystery. But how?
I made a dozen plans, all of which, upon consideration,
appeared so futile, that I gave up the game in despair,
and decided to see if my brain would not become clearer
after I had paid my promised visit to Colonel Maitland.</p>

<p>I did not find Miss Maitland alone, as I expected, or
I might probably have been tempted to confide my
experience to her, and to have asked the assistance of
her woman's wit in putting me on the track of a solution
to the mystery. Mannering was with her. When I
made my appearance in the drawing-room, and found
him enjoying a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, I cursed myself for delaying
my call and thus giving him such an opportunity. My
temper was not improved either by the discovery that
they were sufficiently engrossed in conversation to have
been able very well to dispense with my presence. I
did not feel called upon to leave Mannering a clear
field, however, so I joined in the discussion, and tried
my hardest to be pleasant.</p>

<p>Of course, there was only one possible topic of
conversation, the theme which was uttermost in every
one's mind throughout the length and breadth of the
land. It was a difficult subject for me to discuss, and
in a measure it was a difficult subject for Mannering,
inasmuch as it was hard to refrain from reference to
the personal experience we had had with the Motor
Pirate. It became increasingly difficult, when a few
minutes after my arrival Colonel Maitland joined us.</p>

<p>"It was lucky for him he did not meet us, hey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Sutgrove?" said the Colonel. "You, Winter, and
myself, would soon settle a Motor Pirate, wouldn't we?"</p>

<p>I muttered something which would pass for an assent,
while Mannering shot an amused smile in my direction.</p>

<p>"I wonder though we saw nothing of him," continued
Maitland; "he must have been very near us
last night."</p>

<p>"He seems to have been everywhere," I answered.</p>

<p>"He has the ubiquity of a De Wet," said Mannering.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall have a chance of meeting him sometime,"
I continued grimly.</p>

<p>Colonel Maitland chuckled. "Heavens! What a
fire-eater you are, Sutgrove. One might almost take you
for a sub in a cavalry regiment."</p>

<p>I made no answer, and Miss Maitland remarked&mdash;"I
think that is very unkind of you. You spoke of the
Motor Pirate as if you owed him a grudge. I think
we all ought to be supremely thankful to him for having
made the wettest day we have had this year pass quite
pleasantly."</p>

<p>Bear him a grudge? I should think I did, but at the
same time, I had no intention of confessing the reason,
so I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then we'll drink long life and prosperity to
him the next time we have a bottle of that same
port your father approved so highly last night." Then
I turned to the Colonel, and made a clumsy attempt
to turn the subject of conversation. "Is your verdict
upon my restaurant equally favourable to-day, sir?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Maitland's eyes twinkled. "I have nothing
to regret. As for the port with which we finished, it
seems to me the sort of stuff dreams are made of. Do
you know that the glass I drank&mdash;was it one glass or
two?&mdash;gave me the most vivid dream I have enjoyed
since my childhood?"</p>

<p>"Indeed! Let's hear it, Colonel," I replied.</p>

<p>"Do tell us," said his daughter, as she rose from
her seat, and put her arms coaxingly round her father's
neck. "Do tell us like a real, good, kind, old-fashioned
parent."</p>

<p>The Colonel passed his hand lovingly over his
daughter's sunny hair.</p>

<p>"Sutgrove and Mannering don't want to hear about
an old fellow's silly dreams," he said. "Besides, it was
all about the Motor Pirate, and I can see that Sutgrove
for one is quite sick of the subject."</p>

<p>I was, and I wasn't, but I speedily declared that
I was not when I saw that his daughter was bent upon
hearing the story. So he started upon a prosy description
as to how the fresh air had sent him to sleep, not saying
a word about the port, and I ceased to listen to him,
preferring to devote the whole of my attention to his
daughter, who had seated herself upon a footstool at
his feet, and was looking up into his face with a pretty
affectionate glance in her deep blue eyes, enough to
set any one longing to be the recipient of similar regard.
Her form, attitude, expression, all made so deep an
impression upon me, that I have only to close my eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
at any time to see her just as she was then&mdash;the little
witch! She knew full well how to make the most
of her attractions, and though she has often declared
since to me that the pose was quite unpremeditated,
I could never quite believe her.</p>

<p>However that may be, I was so fascinated in watching
her&mdash;there was one stray curl which lay like a
strand of woven gold upon her brow. Confound it!
It's all very well for the fellow who writes fiction for
a living to write about people's emotions. He is cold
himself. If he were like me, and wished to describe
his own feelings, he might find himself in the same
difficulty as myself, and give up the attempt.</p>

<p>The Colonel's voice droned on. Suddenly I awoke
to the consciousness that he was speaking of me. I think
it was the fact of his daughter looking at me which
recalled me to attention.</p>

<p>"Sutgrove had just looked back to see if I was
comfortable, when he saw another car on the road behind
us. We had not long passed through Radlett. You
know the straight stretch of road just past the new
Dutch barn on the left&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My attention did not wander any more, and you
may imagine my astonishment at hearing the Colonel
describe in minute detail everything which had befallen
us upon the previous evening. He could tell a story
when he liked, and on this occasion his description of
the shamefaced manner in which Winter had scrambled
out of his car, and had handed over his valuables to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Motor Pirate, was so ludicrous that I was compelled to
laugh at the description. When my turn came to be
described, Miss Maitland and Mannering were just as
much amused, but I am afraid that my attempt to participate
in their mirth was rather forced.</p>

<p>When the story was done, Miss Maitland rose from
her seat at her father's feet, and, putting a hand on each
of his shoulders&mdash;</p>

<p>"You dear, delightful old fibber!" she remarked.
"I don't believe you dreamed that at all. You couldn't."
Then she wheeled round on me. "Now tell me, Mr.
Sutgrove, didn't that dream of father's really happen to
you last night?"</p>

<p>What course was open to me but confession? I
admitted the truth of the story, and the Colonel was so
choked with merriment, that I feared lest he should be
stricken with apoplexy.</p>

<p>"The cream of the joke," he explained, when he
recovered his powers of speech, "was that neither Winter
nor Sutgrove had the slightest idea that I was foxing.
I intended to inform them directly we were clear of
the Pirate; but when I heard them discussing the matter,
and determining to keep silence out of tenderness for
my reputation, I could not resist keeping up the joke."</p>

<p>"I should think it was their own reputations they
were thinking about," said his daughter. "To submit
so tamely to one man is not a very heroic proceeding."</p>

<p>I heard Mannering chuckle, and I felt mad. But
I fancy it was not Mannering's amusement, but my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
own consciousness of the truth of the criticism that
galled.</p>

<p>Colonel Maitland came to my rescue. "I thought
they were very sensible," he said. "Even a cripple with
a gun is better than six sound Tommies unarmed."</p>

<p>"Sensible&mdash;yes," she replied scornfully. "But there
are times when one prefers a little less sense, and a little
more&mdash;shall we say action. I am sure you would not
have obeyed so tamely?" she continued, turning to
Mannering.</p>

<p>He smiled, and I felt as if it would give me exquisite
pleasure to catch him by the throat, and twist the smile
out of his dark, handsome face.</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Maitland," he replied, "you flatter
me. You should not be too hard on Sutgrove. I am
sure that it was only the full comprehension of his own
helplessness which prevented him making a fight of it.
What could he have done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a man should always know what to do!" she
answered petulantly. "Has any one ever tried to hold
you up?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," he answered. "Once when I was
out in the west of the States, some of the regulation
bands tried the game on a train in which I was travelling.
But then, you see, the conductor in the railway-car in
which I happened to be seated had a six-shooter. So
had I. The other passengers got as near the floor as
they possibly could when the shooting began. I was
in pretty good practice in those days, don't you know,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
so the other chaps didn't get much of a look in. We
took the four they left behind them when they bolted
on to the next station with us. Three of them were
buried there, if I remember aright."</p>

<p>"There," said Miss Maitland, with an unmistakable
look of admiration in her eyes; "I knew you were
different."</p>

<p>"But then I was armed. If I had not been, I should
have been on the floor with the other passengers."</p>

<p>In reply she merely gave him one glance. Mannering
returned it with one equally eloquent. I rose, and stalked
to the window. To me Mannering's championship
was an aggravation which I could not bear. Harder
still was it for me to observe the understanding which
obviously existed between him and Miss Maitland.
Hitherto I had imagined that I had as good a chance
of winning her love as he had. But at this moment
I felt that my hopes had been shattered.</p>

<p>I think if I had remained a moment longer in the
room, I should have been unable to restrain an impulse
to knock some of the self-sufficiency out of my rival.
I left.</p>

<p>Colonel Maitland followed me out, and I heard him
ask me to dine with him on the following day to wipe
off the score he owed me.</p>

<p>Without thinking, I accepted. Then I went out
into the rain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>I AM ARRESTED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>As</span> I went away from the Maitlands' house I looked
neither to the right hand nor to the left. Where I went,
whether I trudged along the high road or tramped across
country, I have not to-day the slightest idea. I was so
enveloped in my own misery, that I was absolutely blind
to all external objects. I could think of nothing but my
dead hopes. So onward I went, stumbling and splashing
through the mud, cursing Mannering, cursing the Motor
Pirate, above all cursing myself for my own pusillanimity.
Why had I listened to Winter? Why should I have
allowed myself to be persuaded to play the part of coward,
merely that Winter's car should have been saved from
injury?</div>

<p>For a long while my thoughts were as aimless as
my progress, but gradually out of the incoherence one
idea crystallized. It was not an idea to be proud of.
My bitterness of heart produced the natural result, that
was all&mdash;a burning desire to be revenged upon somebody.
I contemplated revenging myself upon everybody
who had anything to do with my discomfiture, upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Mannering, upon Colonel Maitland, upon the Motor
Pirate. Finally my choice settled upon the person of the
Pirate as the most suitable object; for, next to myself, he
was primarily responsible for my having made so contemptible
a figure.</p>

<p>Of course the decision was absurd. Decisions that
are the outcome of any strong emotion usually are. But
it fulfilled a useful purpose. It gave my mind something
else to feed upon than contemplation of my own
unhappiness. It brought me to myself.</p>

<p>To-day I can laugh when I recall the childishness
of my actions, the outcome of the unreasoned promptings
of my puerile jealousy. For when I came to the
conclusion to avenge my sufferings upon the Motor
Pirate, I suddenly became aware that it was pitch dark;
that I was in the middle of a field; that I was soaked to
the skin; that the rain was still falling heavily; and
that I had not the slightest idea where I was. However,
I added one more to the acts of folly I committed that
day: I solemnly held up my hands to the dripping
heavens and registered my vow of revenge. Then I
pushed on again, but with my physical faculties on the
alert to discover where I was.</p>

<p>I began, too, to feel the discomfort of my position,
and became sensible of a sneaking wish to be before a
comfortable fire. I crossed two or three fields, and
eventually coming to a road I followed it, and, after
paddling through the mud half a mile further, I struck
a village, and in the village an inn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>When I opened the door and walked into the cheerful
lamplight of the bar-parlour, the half-dozen occupants
of the cosy little room stared at me with astonishment.
Well they might. I caught a glimpse of my reflection
in the glass behind the bottles&mdash;if you have ever seen a
corpse fished up by the drags from a river bed, you will
be able to form some idea of the appearance I presented&mdash;so
that I did not resent their stare. In fact, I was
not in a condition to be able to pay much attention to
the curious glances of the villagers. The warmth of
the room together with the sudden cessation of exertion
were for the moment too much for me, and it was as
much as I could do to stagger to the nearest chair.</p>

<p>Fortunately the landlord was a man with some
modicum of common sense. I am quite sure that I
should have been unceremoniously ejected from nine
public houses out of ten. But mine host of the White
Horse&mdash;I learned afterwards that he had been whip to
a well-known hunt in the West country&mdash;was able to
distinguish between fatigue and drunkenness, and he
came at once to my assistance. I heard him speak to
me, but I was totally unable to respond. For a while
indeed I must have verged upon unconsciousness, for the
next thing of which I became aware was of a glass at
my lips containing something sweet and strong.</p>

<p>I sipped. Then I drank. My consciousness returned.
In a couple of minutes I could sit upright.
The landlord was beaming at me with benevolent
interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take another sup, sir," he said. "There's nothing
like maraschino and gin when one is a bit overwrought.
I've known many a gentleman in my part of the
country who would take nothing else, after a hard day
to hounds, to brace him up for those long ten miles
home."</p>

<p>I took another sup, and a good one. Then my
powers of speech returning, I asked where I was. I
found I had not wandered nearly so far as I expected.
I was barely six miles from my home&mdash;at King's
Langley; but this fact was no criterion of the distance
I must have traversed in my mad frenzy, for I saw by
the clock that the hour was ten. It was about five when
I left Colonel Maitland's house, so that I had been
pressing onward for five hours in as wild a night as
any on which I have ever been abroad.</p>

<p>I leaned back in my chair with the object of resting
a few minutes before starting homewards. But, whether
owing to the spirit I had swallowed, or to the heavy
exertion I had undergone, or merely because of my intense
mental fatigue, I felt drowsiness overcoming me so
rapidly that I perceived it would never do for me to give
way to it. Pulling myself together I rose to my feet, at
the same time thrusting my hand into my pocket for
the money to pay for my drink. The mere act of
rising, however, was almost too much for me. My
body felt as stiff as if I had been beaten all over. Only
to move was absolute physical pain. I looked at the
landlord.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am more knocked up than I thought.
Can you manage a hot bath and a bed for me to-night?"
I asked.</p>

<p>He glanced at me curiously, and, after a moment's
consideration, he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll see what the missus'll say."</p>

<p>Luckily "the missus" said "Yes," so ten minutes
later I was sluicing hot water over my aching limbs with
a stable sponge in the bath which, I suspect, did duty on
ordinary occasions for the family washing. Whatever it
was, it did excellently well for my purpose. Gradually
a delicious feeling of relaxation stole over me. I tumbled
between the sheets and was asleep even before my host
entered my room to take away my soaked clothing to be
dried.</p>

<p>My sleep might have lasted one second. In point of
fact I slept until nine o'clock the next morning, and
should have continued to sleep if I had not felt a hand
on my arm shaking me, and heard a voice bidding me
arise. Fancying I was at home, and that my man was
calling me, I said, "All right, Wilson," and turned over
for another snooze.</p>

<p>"Now then, get up out of that!" said the voice.
"None of your shamming! We are not to be put off
that way."</p>

<p>It was not Wilson's voice. Wondering what was
happening, I sat up in bed and rubbed my eyes sleepily.</p>

<p>"What the deuce&mdash;&mdash;!" I began. Then I stopped
suddenly. A couple of constables in uniform stood at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the bedside, and I gathered that it was the voice of the
sergeant which had so rudely disturbed my slumbers.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"You know well enough," replied the sergeant.
"You make haste and dress yourself and come along
with us."</p>

<p>I thought my senses had deserted me.</p>

<p>"What in the name of good fortune for?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"You're not going to kid us, my good feller," he
answered. Adding facetiously, "If we puts a name to it
and calls it piracy on the 'igh road, I wonder what you'll
'ave to say to it, remembering, of course, that anything
you do say will be taken down and used in evidence
against you."</p>

<p>Then all that had happened flashed across my mind;
my strange appearance and arrival at the inn; my
peculiar manner; my possession of plenty of money;
the curious glances of the village folk; the fact that
somewhere in the vicinity the Motor Pirate had last
been seen. Under the circumstances, nothing could
be more likely than that the bucolic intelligence should
jump to the conclusion that I was the famous criminal.
To me, however, the idea seemed so absurd that I fell
into hearty laughter. My merriment seemed to annoy
the sergeant, for he declared crossly that if I did not
dress quickly, he would find himself under the necessity
of taking me away as I was.</p>

<p>I thought it expedient to temporize, and as a result<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of a little diplomacy, in which one of the coins from my
pocket found another resting-place, I obtained permission
to breakfast before I left.</p>

<p>I made a hearty meal, the landlord attending upon
my wants. I was glad to see that he, at least, had no
hand in thrusting upon me the indignity of being
arrested. He explained as much, telling my captors they
were making idiots of themselves. As he seemed trustworthy,
I gave him Winter's address, with instructions
to wire to him, telling him of my predicament, and
asking him to come to my assistance.</p>

<p>Necessarily I gave the instructions in the presence of
the policemen, and directly I had done so I could see that
their cocksureness was shaken. They became more polite
in their attitude, and the sergeant took the trouble to explain
that he was acting under instructions, and had no
option but to insist upon my accompanying him to
Watford.</p>

<p>Into Watford I went accordingly. I am not going to
dwell in any detail upon the incidents of the journey; I
am naturally of a retiring disposition, and every circumstance
attending my progress was in the nature of an outrage
upon my diffidence. For instance, upon my departure
from the inn, the whole of the population from King's
Langley, so far as I could judge, had gathered about the
door of the White Horse to give me a send-off. The
crowd was in no sense a hostile one. The majority of its
component parts, especially the more youthful units,
seemed indeed to view me with admiration not unmixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
with envy. Only one yokel expressed disbelief in my
identity.</p>

<p>"Ee ain't no pirut," he declared with unconcealed
disdain, as he spat into the gutter. "Anybody can see he's
only a toff."</p>

<p>I scarcely knew whether to be pleased with his conclusion
or angry that he should find my personal appearance
so unimpressive; and before I could make up my
mind on the subject, I was seated in the trap provided for
us and driven away seated between the two constables.</p>

<p>Our entry into Watford was still more in the nature
of a triumph. Long before we reached the county police
office I was wild enough, at being made such an exhibition
of, to have given ten years of my life for the chance of
punching the head of any one of the throng of gaping onlookers.
Then, as a culminating blow to my pride, who
should we meet at a point in the High Street where it
was impossible to avoid recognition, but my rival Mannering
in his trumpery old motor-car, accompanied by&mdash;above
all persons in the world, the one I least desired to see&mdash;Miss
Maitland.</p>

<p>I ground my teeth with rage, and as I alighted and
followed the sergeant into the police station, I wished that
I were the Motor Pirate in reality.</p>

<p>When I reached the presence of the officer in charge
of the station I just managed to control my temper, though
I fancy there must have been traces of my rage still visible
in my voice as I demanded to know why a peaceable
citizen should be subjected to such ignominy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The inspector in reply merely asked me for my name
and address.</p>

<p>Before meeting Miss Maitland I had cherished the
hope that my identity would not be disclosed, but now
I had no further reason for desiring to conceal it, I gave
both at once.</p>

<p>The inspector quietly made a note of them, while
another man in plain clothes, who was standing gazing
out of the window, suddenly turned on me with the
inquiry&mdash;</p>

<p>"How comes it, Mr. Sutgrove, that living at St.
Albans you should choose to spend the night at a little inn
at King's Langley?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I am at liberty to sleep where I like?" I
retorted.</p>

<p>"Perfectly so," replied the stranger. "You will have
no difficulty, I presume, in proving your identity?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," I said. "In fact I have already
wired to a friend of mine&mdash;Mr. Winter, of Hailscombe,
St. Albans&mdash;to come here for the purpose."</p>

<p>"I know Mr. Winter very well," said the inspector.</p>

<p>The stranger looked at me keenly, and when his
scrutiny was completed he fell to whistling a bar of
Chopin's <i>Marche Fun&egrave;bre</i>. Then he turned to his colleague
in uniform.</p>

<p>"It's no go," he said. "This is not our man."
Again he turned to me. "I am Inspector Forrest of
Scotland Yard, detailed for special duty in connection with
this Motor Pirate affair. Unfortunately I did not reach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Watford until after arrangements had been made to bring
you here, or&mdash;&mdash; I hope you will not take it amiss if
we detain you until Mr. Winter's arrival."</p>

<p>This gave me the opening I had been wishing for, and
I took it. I said a lot more than I can recall now, though
I can remember a good deal. Most of it was to the effect
that I would make somebody pay dearly for the annoyance
to which I had been subjected.</p>

<p>Inspector Forrest listened patiently to me until I had
finished.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Sutgrove!" he said then. "You
must not bear any malice. Surely you must admit that
appearances were not altogether in your favour," and he
detailed to me the information which had led to my
arrest. "You see," he said in conclusion, "that practically
we had no option in the matter."</p>

<p>I dissented from his view. He said a word to the
inspector in uniform, who left us alone in the room.
Then he came close to me and remarked in a confidential
tone.</p>

<p>"The fact is, our friend, who has just left us, has
been too precipitate. You can make things exceedingly
unpleasant for him if you like; but frankly, is it worth
while? Think it over a little, bearing in mind that if we
are to get hold of the Motor Pirate, we must take the
chance of capturing the wrong man, since there is no
description of him obtainable. You will not be the only
one, I'll swear."</p>

<p>Since I had relieved my mind I felt better. Besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I was rather attracted by the personality of the man who
was speaking to me. He did not at all fulfil my idea of
a detective. He was a tall, slight, stiffly built man,
with a pleasant open face and an agreeable manner. I
saw, too, that I had only my own folly to blame for the
predicament in which I now found myself.</p>

<p>In another ten minutes he was smoking one of my
cigars and we were chatting confidentially. Before
twenty had elapsed, I had confided to him not only Winter's
and my own experience with the Motor Pirate, but
also the chain of events which had led to my spending the
night at the inn. He was exceedingly sympathetic and
quite grave throughout, though he appeared more interested
in the encounter with the Pirate than in the
account of my mental tortures. However, when I told
him of my vow, he brightened up and asked me if I was
still determined to keep it.</p>

<p>I had just assured him that I would willingly spend
the rest of my life in the quest, when the other inspector
entered the room and with him Winter. The latter came
straight across to me and held out his hand, and never in
my life was I so glad to see his honest face and beaming
smile.</p>

<p>"What have you been up to now, Sutgrove?" he
remarked. "Not emulating the deeds of the Motor
Pirate?"</p>

<p>"The police have somehow arrived at the conclusion
that I am that distinguished person himself," I replied
ruefully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>He roared with laughter. It was infectious. There
was no help for it. The two inspectors joined in the
merriment, and the last of my anger was borne away on
the flood.</p>

<p>There was of course no question of my further detention.
In a few minutes I was seated beside Winter in his
car, and we were making the mud fly as we dashed
towards St. Albans.</p>

<p>Inspector Forrest accompanied us. I had promised to
find him some lunch if he would do so, and to drive him
back afterwards, and he was glad of the opportunity of
obtaining from us such particulars as we could furnish
him with concerning the person of whom he was in
search.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>I MAKE FRIENDS WITH INSPECTOR FORREST, C.I.D.</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class='smcap'>The</span> telegraph," said Inspector Forrest, sententiously
"is even more speedy than the Motor Pirate."</div>

<p>"Unless you want to send a message from Regent
Street to the City," I remarked; "in which case one
would save time by employing a sloth as messenger."</p>

<p>The inspector waved aside the objection as frivolous.
He occupied an easy chair opposite me; he was smoking
one of my best cigars with every sign of active enjoyment;
he sipped his glass of claret&mdash;he rarely touched
anything stronger, he informed me&mdash;with the air of a
connoisseur.</p>

<p>"We shall beat him with the telegraph," said he.
"Clearly he has one retreat where he can put up his car
in safety. Probably he has more than one. It is not
impossible for him to have several. There might even
be a number of Motor Pirates, members of the same
gang, but selecting different parts of the country upon
which to prey. The telegraph will soon settle these
points for us. When next he makes his appearance we
shall be able to keep watch upon him, to note, if not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
exact spot, at least in what part of the country he makes
his appearance. Even if it should be found impossible
to arrest him in his progress, he is bound to leave some
traces behind him which will enable us to get upon
his track."</p>

<p>"He does not seem to have left many behind him
at present," I replied.</p>

<p>"No," said the inspector thoughtfully, as he rose and
examined the map spread out upon the table. "Yet
there are certainly grounds for believing that he has gone
to earth somewhere in this neighbourhood. The Hertfordshire
police may have been nearer the mark than you
thought when they arrested you."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you still suspect me?"
I cried.</p>

<p>"Not for one instant," he answered promptly.
"The meaning I meant to convey was that, quite unknown
to you, the Motor Pirate may very well be your
near neighbour. I suppose there is no one residing
near whom you would consider a likely object of
suspicion?"</p>

<p>There flashed across my mind the strange similarity
between Mannering's voice and the Motor Pirate's.
But the notion was so absurd I was ashamed to mention
it. I assured the inspector I knew of no one.</p>

<p>"At all events, my belief is strong enough to keep
me in this district until I hear something further," he
declared, as he finished the contents of his glass and
glanced at his watch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then I caught sight of Mannering coming up
the path through the garden towards my front door.</p>

<p>"You had better stay a little longer," I said to the
inspector. "Here is another man coming who may be
able to give you some more details of the Pirate. He
has seen him, and as he has been a longer resident here
than myself, he may be able to tell you more about the
people round than I can."</p>

<p>"A motorist?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, named Mannering," I replied. "He is the
man I told you about, whom I consider to be my rival,
you know."</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes twinkled. "I shouldn't let him
drive me into any more adventures like last night's,
Mr. Sutgrove," he advised. "If you were ten years older&mdash;my
age, you know&mdash;you wouldn't need the warning,
A bout of rheumatic fever would be small consolation
for the loss of the lady."</p>

<p>I could not reply, for at that moment Mannering
entered.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you home again, Sutgrove," he said
heartily. "I'm not the only one either. Miss Maitland
asked me to call, for after seeing you in such bad
company this morning&mdash;&mdash; Hullo! I beg your pardon,
I thought you were alone." He stopped suddenly on
catching sight of Inspector Forrest.</p>

<p>I introduced my guest and Mannering acknowledged
the introduction easily.</p>

<p>"Inspector Forrest will assure you that I have only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
been unfortunate enough to have been the object of our
local constabulary's misplaced zeal. They took me for
our mutual friend the Motor Pirate."</p>

<p>"Did they though? What an almighty spoof!"
said Mannering. "First time I ever heard of a man
being run in for robbing himself on the high-road.
Beats Gilbert!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sutgrove did not see the point of the joke at
first," said the inspector. I saw that as he spoke he was
taking note of Mannering in much the same way as he
had taken stock of me at the police office.</p>

<p>Mannering appeared to be quite unconscious of his
regard, for he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't suppose I should have relished such a mistake
myself. Anyway," he continued, turning to me, "you
have the consolation of knowing that you are not the
only victim of police enterprise. I see from the papers
quite half a dozen motor pirates have been run in.
They may have the real one amongst them; but as his
car has so far escaped capture, I doubt it."</p>

<p>"So do I," I remarked. "And for the additional
reason that I have a sort of presentiment that when his
capture is brought about, I am going to have a hand in it."</p>

<p>"What do you say to that, Inspector?" he answered.
"Are you going to leave the job to amateurs?"</p>

<p>"I never said 'no' to the offer of assistance in
running down a criminal," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I have sworn," I remarked obstinately, "that I
will not rest until he is safe under lock and key."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"You had better be prepared," answered Mannering.
"I should judge him to be a bit of a fighter."</p>

<p>"Next time I meet him, I'll take all risks to come
to close quarters," I continued.</p>

<p>"You haven't a car to do a hundred miles an hour,
have you?" he said in a bantering voice.</p>

<p>"My plan is a simple one. I merely propose to go
out for night rides until he finds me," I said.</p>

<p>"I had some thoughts of amusing myself in the
same way," he answered. "But, judging from your
experience this morning, the only thing likely to happen
is being arrested on suspicion."</p>

<p>"I'll take my chance of that," I said. "But before
discussing the matter, perhaps you could tell Inspector
Forrest whether there's any spot in this neighbourhood
likely to serve as a hiding-place for the Pirate's car?"</p>

<p>A smile lit up Mannering's face. "There's the old
coach-house at the bottom of the paddock next to my
cottage. It has a door opening on to the main road.
There would be room, too, in my stables, if I had not
fitted them up as workshops for my tyre experiments."</p>

<p>"Stop rotting," I said, "the inspector really means it."</p>

<p>He became grave instantly. "Sorry I can't suggest
a likely spot," he said, and then for a few minutes he
answered the questions the detective put to him as to
what he had seen of the Pirate.</p>

<p>He could give little information of any value, and
when Inspector Forrest had elicited all that he could, he
thanked Mannering and rose to depart. I accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
him to the garden gate. He appeared a little loth to leave
me. Twice he turned away and returned to make some
objectless remark to me. The third time he blurted out&mdash;</p>

<p>"About that suggestion of yours&mdash;taking night rides
on the chance of being held up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" I said and waited.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a good fast car at my disposal," he <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'continue'">continued</ins>
earnestly; "but the Yard would never run to it."</p>

<p>I felt a pleasant thrill run through me. It would be
good to have his companionship and assistance in working
out my self-imposed vow.</p>

<p>"If you can make use of it, I will see that the best car
money can buy is placed at your disposal," I replied eagerly.</p>

<p>He took my hand and shook it warmly. "I'll see
what my chief says," he replied. "When can I see
you again?"</p>

<p>"I shall be leaving here at eight and returning well&mdash;between
ten and eleven."</p>

<p>"Expect me about midnight," he said, and without
another word or backward glance he stepped out in the
direction of St. Albans.</p>

<p>I returned to Mannering, who did not, however,
favour me with a very lengthy visit. Possibly he found
my manner rather cool, but the fact was, that try as
I would to curb my feelings, I could not but resent
something of an air of proprietorship which I thought
appeared in his tone when referring to Miss Maitland.</p>

<p>When he had departed, I got out all the catalogues
of motor-cars I could lay my hands upon, and studied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
them until it was time to dress for dinner. Several
times I thought of breaking the appointment, for I knew
I should have to give some explanation of my arrest,
and how to do so without appearing an egregious ass
I did not know. Finally I determined, if the opportunity
were afforded me, to tell the exact truth, at least to the
only person whose opinion I cared about.</p>

<p>I was glad afterwards that I had not sent my excuses,
for I was lucky enough to find Miss Maitland alone
in the drawing-room when I arrived. It seemed, too,
as if she had determined to make amends for the mental
torture she had unwittingly caused me the previous
evening. So it happened that when she questioned me
as to how I managed to get into such a predicament,
I told her as clearly as I could of the state of my feelings.
It was a blundering, halting statement I made, of that
I am certain, and before I had completed it Colonel
Maitland's entry closed my mouth. But I think she
understood, for there was a little flush on her cheek
when we went into dinner which had not been there
when I greeted her, and a pretty air of seriousness in
the glances she bestowed upon me, which I had never
noticed before.</p>

<p>As far as the Colonel was concerned, he did not
worry me for any explanations. He was bent on
enlarging my knowledge of gastronomy, and having a
new cook, he was much too deeply interested in the
<i>menu</i> to spare any thoughts for my erratic movements.
I am afraid, though, his teaching was wasted on me; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
while I managed to reply to his conversation, I had not
the slightest idea what I was eating. My principal
longing was to get the meal over in order that I might
finish the conversation which had opened so auspiciously.
The opportunity was not afforded me on that occasion,
however, but the evening did not pass without my
obtaining a glimmering of hope.</p>

<p>When Miss Maitland rose I asked her, in a voice
which was low enough not to reach her father's ear,
whether she would answer me one question.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said, and her face flushed a little
as she came to the door.</p>

<p>"Is there any one else?" I asked, my hand on the knob.</p>

<p>"What right have you to ask?" she answered.</p>

<p>"No right, I only ask it of your mercy," I replied.</p>

<p>She hesitated, then with flushed cheeks and a soft
whispered "No one," she escaped through the door.</p>

<p>Over the port I took my new-found courage in both
hands, and asked the Colonel's consent to my suit. I
gained it. He even expressed the hope that I should
succeed, but he warned me at the same time that I must
not depend upon him for any assistance. He declared
himself to be clay in the hands of his daughter.</p>

<p>"Evie always had her own way from the cradle,"
he declared, "and always will have her own way. If
I were to say that I thought you would make her a good
husband, I'm not sure whether she would not consider
it a sufficient excuse to accept Mannering straight away.
Personally I should much prefer you, but there's no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
counting on a woman's tastes, either in men or wines.
And Evie is a perfect woman, God bless her!"</p>

<p>I drained my glass to the toast and made an excuse
to get away to the drawing-room. But I did not see
her alone again that evening. Winter and his wife had
walked over. Mannering did not put in an appearance,
and his absence was something to be thankful for; and when
I held her hand in mine as I bade her good night, I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have told me there is no one else. Is there
any hope for me?"</p>

<p>She made no pretence of misunderstanding my meaning.
She looked at me saucily, her lips parted lightly,
her eyes brimming with laughter.</p>

<p>"Come and ask me when&mdash;when you have caught
the Motor Pirate," she said, and with that answer I was
fain to be content.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that I found myself fully committed
to the work which was at that time engaging the
attention of the whole of the police throughout the land.
I welcomed the task. Luck might be on my side,
especially if my new friend the detective inspector's
assistance proved to be available.</p>

<p>And as regards assurance on this point, I had not long
to wait before my mind was at ease. I found him
awaiting me at my garden gate when I returned home.
I invited him in so eagerly that he smiled.</p>

<p>"There's no need to ask if you are still as keen on
this job as you were this afternoon," he said, as he
entered my snuggery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keener than ever," I asseverated.</p>

<p>"Then I hope between us we may be successful in
running our man to ground."</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything further?" I inquired,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the slightest value. A number of
people have been through our hands, but of the Pirate&mdash;not
a sign."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall get a clue in the morning," I
hazarded.</p>

<p>"At present," he declared, "there's not a shred of
a clue to work upon. Of course at any moment
information may come to hand. He may endeavour
to dispose of some of his plunder, or he may reappear, but
until then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you suggest?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I shall stay and thoroughly explore this district
until I hear something further," he answered.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of going into town in the morning,
to see if a more powerful car than the one I possess at
present is to be obtained," I told him later. "I am
hoping to get one capable of doing fifty or even sixty
miles an hour at a pinch, so as to be prepared for
emergencies. Meanwhile, if you like to make this house
your headquarters, I shall be delighted to put you up."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that, Mr. Sutgrove?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," I replied.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, then he accepted my invitation.
Luck was on my side after all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>MURDER</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>I learned</span> to know Inspector Forrest very well during
the next fortnight, better perhaps, since during that time
the Motor Pirate gave absolutely no sign of existence.
It seemed as if, contented with the sensation he had
created and the plunder he had secured, he had retired
into the obscurity from which he originally emerged.</div>

<p>For two reasons I was not sorry for this interval.
In the first place, I found I could not get immediately
the type of car I wanted. Manufacturers and agents
were willing enough to book orders, but none of them
had in stock the high-speed automobile such as I required.
Only after a long day's hunt did I discover an
agent who thought that he could obtain for me a 60-h.p.
Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, and then it would have to be sent from
Paris. At my suggestion, he telephoned through an
order that the car should be despatched to him at once;
but two or three days elapsed before its arrival in
London, and then there were certain alterations which
I required to be made which took a week to complete.
I was glad, therefore, that my enemy did not make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
reappearance until I was provided for him. When the
new Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s was delivered to me I was delighted
with it, especially when I found on my return from
the trial run the engines worked as smoothly as when
I started.</p>

<p>The other reason why I did not regret the Pirate's
quiescence was because of the opportunity afforded me
of cementing the friendship which had grown up between
myself and the detective. It became a very
real and warm friendship during those long idle days.
He upset all my preconceived notions of the police, at
least as regards the detective portion of the force, he
was such an all-round man. He had not allowed his
undoubted powers of observation to be entirely concentrated
upon the seamy side of his profession. Judging
from his conversation, I gathered that he knew quite
as much about modern French literature as he did
about French criminals, and of the latter his knowledge
was both extensive and interesting. I remember on
one occasion that he gave me a really acute criticism
of the Verlain school, with special relation to the effects
of decadent literature on national life. But that is
only one example of his scope. Wherever he had been
and whatever he had done, had apparently awakened
in him the desire to see all round the case he was
investigating, and being possessed of a well-trained
memory, his mind was a storehouse of curious knowledge.</p>

<p>Let me give one instance. One evening when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
were driving slowly along a bye-road in the vicinity
of Uxbridge, in accordance with our preconceived plan&mdash;the
Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s had not then arrived, and our progress
was additionally slow as the roads were exceedingly
heavy, as rain had been falling daily ever since the
night I had been arrested&mdash;suddenly my companion
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of Persian poetry, Mr.
Sutgrove?"</p>

<p>As it happened, owing to the fact that a Sutgrove
had once represented his country at the Persian court,
I had a slight knowledge of the subject, and I said so.</p>

<p>"I am never out of doors on a spring evening," he
continued, "without wishing I had the time to acquire
a knowledge of it."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It's this way," he replied. "On one of my jobs&mdash;a
show job, attendance on a distinguished visitor,
don't you know&mdash;I was thrown a great deal into the
company of a Persian gentleman, and we did our best
to learn something of each other's languages. He taught
me out of Hafiz, and I picked up just enough to make
me wish for more. Listen to this."</p>

<p>He recited to me one of the shorter poems from the
Divan.</p>

<p>"Isn't that musical?" he continued. "It seems
to me to have the real poetry of the spring evening
in it."</p>

<p>I agreed with him, and we were silent for a while.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Later he asked me diffidently not to mention to any one
his penchant for Persian poetry.</p>

<p>"Even at the Yard," he explained, "I doubt whether
they would put it down to my credit."</p>

<p>I gave him the assurance he asked for, and from that
time forth I came to look upon him as a personal friend.
I confided wholly to him the hopes I entertained in
regard to my love affair; and he assured me that if he
had anything to do with it, I should also have a hand in
the arrest of the Pirate.</p>

<p>All our time was not spent, however, in pleasant
excursions about the country. Forrest was by no means
idle; he had been busy perfecting his scheme for utilizing
the telegraph in notifying the Pirate's reappearance
when it should be made. Then he had in addition
thoroughly and minutely explored the whole of the
country round, to see if any trace of the strange visitor
were obtainable. His endeavours were quite fruitless,
but he still held to his belief that he could not be far
away; and the next time the Pirate did make his appearance
he was confirmed in his opinion.</p>

<p>The weather had been fine for three days in succession,
there had been a drying breeze, and the roads from
sloppy quagmires became in such perfect condition that
I was looking forward to a really good spin. But
Forrest had other views for the evening of the third
day.</p>

<p>"I don't think," he remarked, as he sipped his coffee
after our early dinner, "we can afford to spend the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
night ranging the highways. Business first and pleasure
afterwards."</p>

<p>"I thought you were of opinion that our friend
will be tempted to make his reappearance to-night?" I
remarked.</p>

<p>"I am," he answered; "and therefore the best thing,
we can do is to wait until we hear in which direction
he makes his reappearance. If we wait in St. Albans
at the end of the telegraph wire, we shall be much more
likely to meet him than running about at random."</p>

<p>There was so much good sense in the suggestion that
I resigned myself to the inevitable waste of time, and
I had my reward. About eleven a message came over
the wire: "Motor Pirate seen near Towcester going
in the direction of Daventry."</p>

<p>"How far is Towcester?" asked Forrest, the moment
he heard the message.</p>

<p>"Roughly, I should say forty miles," I answered.</p>

<p>"We ought to manage it within the hour, then," he
remarked. "Come along."</p>

<p>Without another word we seated ourselves in the
car, and with a continuous toot-toot of the horn we
rolled out of the town. Directly we were clear of the
houses, I jammed on the highest speed. I cannot say
that I felt quite comfortable, for though I knew the road,
the night was very dark, the light we threw ahead was
so bright as to dazzle my eyes, and hitherto I had no
experience of driving a 60-h.p. motor at top speed
through the darkness. My companion's <i>sang-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'freid'">froid</ins></i> soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
reassured me, however, and as soon as we were fairly
going, the sting of the night air as it whipped my cheeks
brought a sense of exhilaration which would have sufficed
to banish my fears had there been time to have entertained
any. But there was not. If you have ever
driven a speedy automobile at top speed through a dark
night, you will readily understand that there is little
opportunity for the brain to cultivate imaginary perils.
If you do not believe me, try it for yourself and see.</p>

<p>In about sixteen minutes we were at Dunstable.
Passing through the town slowly, Forrest got news that
the police were watching all the roads, but that nothing
had been seen there of the Pirate. Another quarter of
an hour brought us to Fenny Stratford. Here we wasted
another minute or so in obtaining similar negative information.
By this time I was feeling confidence in my car
and in my powers to manage it. Once clear of the
houses again, I let her rip for all she was worth; we
simply flew along. With my right hand on the wheel,
my feet on the two pedals, I sat as tense as a fiddle string,
my one object to peer into the road ahead.</p>

<p>We had covered ten of the fifteen miles between
Stratford and Towcester, when I became aware of a
deeper blotch on the blackness ahead. With one movement
I pressed down the clutch and jammed on the
breaks. I was just in time. The car pulled up in its
own length, though it swerved to such an extent that
I thought we should be overturned.</p>

<p>There, standing still within the circle of our lights,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was another motor-car. It had no lamps burning, but
it was shivering with the vibration of its engine running
free.</p>

<p>"The Pirate!" I shouted.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Forrest, jumping down and
approaching the stranger.</p>

<p>I followed his example, and the first thing I observed
about the car was that all the lights were out, and I
wondered that any motorist in his senses should have
courted the accident which so nearly occurred.</p>

<p>There was one occupant of the car, and he was
sitting bolt upright with one hand on a lever beside him.
I shouted something at him angrily as I approached, but
he made no response.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Are you asleep, sir?" said Forrest, as he
put one foot on the step and grasped the silent motorist
by the arm.</p>

<p>There was no reply. I saw Forrest leave his hold
on the stranger, and, stepping back into the road, draw
his hand across his brow.</p>

<p>"My God!" he muttered</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>Forrest caught his breath sharply. "A piece more
of the Motor Pirate's work, I fancy," he said slowly;
"and this time, I think it spells&mdash;murder."</p>

<p>For a minute I stood absolutely still. It was one of
the most eerie moments of my life. Above and about
us the black night, beside us the two cars coughing
and grunting as if anxious to be moving, and that silent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
figure sitting up erect upon his seat, utterly unconscious
of the two persons standing watching him with horror-stricken
faces.</p>

<p>Forrest's voice, clear, cool, incisive, brought me to
myself.</p>

<p>"One of your lamps here, Sutgrove, if you can
manage it."</p>

<p>I took a lamp from its socket, and held it while the
detective made a brief inspection. It took him a very
short time to assure him that his surmise was near the
truth.</p>

<p>It was murder.</p>

<p>Right in the centre of the forehead of the silent
figure was a small blue hole, so cleanly drilled that it
scarcely marred the features of the dead man. One
hand still grasped the lever, the other had dropped
slightly. When the light fell upon it, I perceived the
fingers to be tightly clasped about the butt of a revolver.</p>

<p>Forrest lifted the hand and glanced at the weapon.
"One cartridge discharged," he said. "Surely it cannot
be a case of suicide?"</p>

<p>Just at that moment I caught sight of a piece of
paper pinned to the dead man's coat. I pointed it out to
Forrest. He unfolded it, glanced at it, and handed it to
me without a word.</p>

<p>It was just a half sheet of ordinary paper used for
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'typeing'">typing</ins>, and upon it was typed the following sentence&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the fate awaiting those who venture to
resist the Motor Pirate."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would seem to settle the question as to whether
this is a case of suicide or not," I said, handing back the
paper to the inspector.</p>

<p>"H'm! At all events the inquest will," he replied.
"I'm afraid in any case this ends our pursuit for the
night," he continued. "I think I must ask you to run
on to the nearest town for assistance. Have you any idea
of our whereabouts?"</p>

<p>By calculating the time which had elapsed since
leaving Stratford with the pace at which we had been
travelling, I came to the conclusion we were not very
far from Towcester, and I suggested I had better go
there.</p>

<p>"All right; cut along then. Revolver handy?"</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative as I mounted my car.</p>

<p>"Wait one moment," he called as I was starting;
"and bring your light on a bit."</p>

<p>I did as I was directed. Forrest took one of the
lamps and walked for five yards up the road, examining
carefully every inch of the roadway. At last he paused.</p>

<p>"Here is where the Pirate's motor stopped," he said;
and, plumping down upon his knees, he examined the
surface carefully. Then, taking a tape from his pocket,
he made a series of measurements.</p>

<p>I inquired what he was doing. He grunted in reply.
When he had finished he remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing much to be got out of that. Judging
from my measurements, our friend might be driving a
Daimler."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Another thought struck him, and, before starting, he
asked me to lend him a hand in getting the other car to
the side of the road, in case any one else came along and
fell upon the fate we had so narrowly escaped. Then
I was at liberty to proceed, and, getting once more into
my own vehicle, I let the Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s drive ahead.</p>

<p>But my nerve had gone. Every moment I fancied
weird shapes in the blackness before me. Every moment
I heard in my ears the strange humming of the Pirate.
Yet I dared not look round, lest I should in that instant
come upon him unawares in the shadows in front.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had no long distance to traverse.
Soon friendly lights broke the darkness. Slackening
pace, I found myself in the well-ordered streets of a little
town. The second person I met was a policeman, and,
hailing him, I bade him jump on the car and direct me
to the police-station. Nothing loth, he obeyed.</p>

<p>I have an idea that the story I told the sergeant in
charge was more than a little incoherent, but he understood
me sufficiently to become aware that his presence
was required immediately at the scene of a crime, and
he gave me to understand that he was ready to accompany
me forthwith. Then I remembered Forrest asking
me to see that the services of a medical man were obtained,
in order that he might make an examination of
the body before its removal, and I mentioned the matter
to the sergeant. He at once gave instructions to the
constable who had guided me to the station to knock up
a doctor and follow us at once with him, so there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
very little delay before I was once more driving my car
at full speed towards the scene of the tragedy.</p>

<p>By this time my nerve had returned. One reason
may have been that I had taken advantage of the slight
delay, occasioned by the sergeant giving instructions to
his subordinate, to brace myself with a stiff whisky-and-soda
from the small supply I carried on the car for
emergencies. Now, too, I had the companionship of
another able-bodied man on the car with me. I felt that,
even if the mysterious murderer were to make his appearance,
I should have a better chance of tackling him.</p>

<p>We were not long in reaching our destination. In
fact a very few minutes elapsed before we came to the
spot where the motor-car stood, with the rigid figure of
its owner still in the position I had left him. I pulled
up beside the derelict.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Forrest!" I shouted.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The detective had disappeared.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>EXPLAINS A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>I sprang</span> to the ground by the side of the death-car.
It was standing by the side of the road, just as I had left
it, its silent owner sitting rigidly erect, still grasping the
lever, and looking fixedly into the darkness.</div>

<p>"Forrest! Forrest!" I shouted again.</p>

<p>All was silent as the grave.</p>

<p>It was very strange. He had promised to await my
return. I looked at my watch. Altogether half an
hour had not elapsed since my departure. Yet many
things might happen in half an hour with such a spirit
of death abroad as I knew to be hovering around. I
shivered.</p>

<p>The police sergeant was as much bewildered at
Forrest's disappearance as myself. On our way, I had
explained more fully the circumstances under which we
had discovered the crime which had been committed.
He knew my companion by name and reputation, and
he was quite at a loss to explain his absence.</p>

<p>I scanned the road so far as it was revealed by our
lights, half expecting yet dreading to see his prostrate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
form. But there was nothing visible. Each taking a
lamp from my car, the sergeant and I set out to search
the hedges and ditches on each side of the road. We
did so conscientiously for a hundred yards up and down
the road, and on each side, but found nothing.</p>

<p>When we got back to the car, the sergeant said to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Forrest has found a clue, and thought
he would waste no time in following it up."</p>

<p>The suggestion seemed feasible enough, but just at
that moment my glance fell on something at my feet
which put the idea to flight. Lying on the road was
a large button. I picked it up. I saw at once that it
had been torn violently away from the garment to which
it had been attached, for a piece of the cloth had come
away with it, I looked at it narrowly&mdash;the cloth was
of the same material as the overcoat Forrest had been
wearing.</p>

<p>The button had been almost under the wheels of my
car, so I backed the Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s a few yards, and looked
about for further traces. In the space thus laid bare there
lay a lamp smashed to pieces. I picked up the frame,
and saw that it was one of the lamps taken from the
other motor. Further search only revealed another
button similarly attached to a shred of cloth like the
first one I had found. That was all.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked at me and I at him. One
thought was in both our minds, and we gave utterance
to it simultaneously.</p>

<p>"The Motor Pirate has been back again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must have scared him away the first time,
and on his return to complete the job he found the
inspector here, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sergeant did not complete his sentence, but
glanced apprehensively up and down the road.</p>

<p>"If he has returned, I don't see what he can have
done with Forrest," I replied.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!" the man replied, involuntarily
lowering his voice. "I&mdash;I begin to believe that this
Motor Pirate is&mdash;is the Devil."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man!" I said sharply.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, my own nerves, in spite of the
whisky, were in none too firm a condition; and I knew
it would be fatal to allow myself to become infected by
the very obvious funk which had seized upon my companion.
I felt, however, I must be doing something
unless I wanted to succumb.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "you wait by the car a few
minutes, while I go two or three hundred yards further
up the road, to see if I can find any other traces."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I would much rather you&mdash;you didn't leave
me," stammered the sergeant. "It's bad enough for
there to be only the two of us."</p>

<p>"Come, pull yourself together," I replied roughly.
"There's nothing to be afraid of."</p>

<p>"I don't think I can stand being left here alone,"
repeated the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Very well; you had better come along with me
then," I replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>He jumped into the car beside me with alacrity, and
I started the motor, though not until I had arranged
my revolver handily at my side. We went for a mile
at our slowest pace in the direction of Stratford, and
finding nothing, we returned, and covered the same
distance in the direction of Towcester, with a similar
result. Our progress was brought to a termination by
our meeting with a trap containing the doctor, who
was accompanied by a couple of constables. When we
recognized who was approaching, the change that came
over the demeanour of the sergeant was astonishing.
All his courage came back to him. He talked to me
quite easily as we returned to the scene of the outrage
with the trap keeping close behind us; and when we
pulled up, he took control of the proceedings as if he
had never felt a moment's tremor in his life. He must
have observed my astonishment, for he took me aside
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was a bit overcome just now, sir. You won't
mention it before my men."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I answered. "I was only one
degree better myself."</p>

<p>"That's enough to make any one feel creepy," he
said, jerking his thumb towards the silent figure.</p>

<p>We did nothing but stand about and talk in subdued
tones, until the doctor had completed his examination
of the silent figure by the light of my lamps. It did
not last long.</p>

<p>"Death was instantaneous," he said, as he stepped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
down from the car. "The bullet appears to have passed
straight along the longitudinal sinus, and, as near as I
can tell, he must have been dead about an hour."</p>

<p>"You would like to make a more extensive examination,
I suppose, doctor?" said the sergeant.</p>

<p>"If a suitable place were available," he replied.</p>

<p>The sergeant mentioned an inn at a village not far
distant, and, the doctor acquiescing, arrangements were
at once made for conveying the body there, the
sergeant and I setting out in advance to provide for
its reception.</p>

<p>I am not going into any further detail regarding the
proceedings of that night. Indeed I can to-day scarcely
recall them. I know that I waited at the inn for a
long while after the melancholy <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> arrived, and that
I felt curiously dazed amidst all the bustle caused by
the arrival. I remember eventually driving the sergeant
back to Towcester, and making to him a long statement,
which he took down in writing.</p>

<p>By the time I had completed this statement day had
dawned. I shall never forget my impressions of that
early morning as I rode home alone. The birds were
twittering in the hedgerows, a soft white mist hung low
down over the meadows, all nature was so serene and
peaceful that it was difficult to imagine that the night
which had passed had been so full of horror and mystery.
I felt as one awakened from a dream. But on my way
I passed the deserted motor-car. A constable was beside
it, and I pulled up to speak to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seen nothing of Inspector Forrest, I suppose?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied.</p>

<p>I gave him good morning and got on. I made
similar inquiries at Fenny Stratford, and again at Dunstable,
still without result. I comforted myself with the
thought that at St. Albans I should certainly hear news
of him. But no. I found the police wild with excitement,
but entirely without any information as to what
had become of the missing detective. I found, however,
that they did not share my forebodings as to anything
serious having happened to him. Their view was that
he had discovered some clue, and was hard upon the
track of the murderer. I had to give them a complete
history of the events of the night. But I got away at
last, and reached home as tired as I had ever been in
my life.</p>

<p>I took a bath as hot as I could bear it, and went
straight to bed. I was dead beat, and I fell asleep
instantly.</p>

<p>I awoke some time in the afternoon, and when I
had got the sleep out of my eyes, and the events of the
previous night came back to me, I felt inclined to curse
myself for having thought of resting. I felt certain that
if it had been myself who was missing, Forrest would
not have slept until he had discovered something concerning
my fate. I made a hasty meal while dressing,
and ordered my car to be brought round. Directly it
appeared I hurried off to St. Albans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing had been seen or heard there of Forrest,
and once more I set out upon the road I had traversed
the previous night. Again I rode as far as Towcester.
I had a chat with the sergeant of police, and found that,
though search parties had scoured the country round for
miles, no intelligence had been obtained. I made
arrangements to appear at the inquest on the following
day, and returned to St. Albans. Still no news.</p>

<p>I got home again about seven, sick at heart. I had
counted so much upon Forrest's assistance in the fulfilment
of my vow; but that was only a secondary consideration
now. I had grown to like him so much, that
the idea that he had met with any mischance knocked
me over completely. I went into my study and threw
myself moodily into a chair. My man brought me in
some whisky, and hovered about until I told him
to go.</p>

<p>"You were going to dine at Mr. Winter's to-night,
sir, with Mr. Forrest," he reminded me.</p>

<p>The engagement had completely passed from my
memory.</p>

<p>"I shall be unable to go, Wilson," I said.</p>

<p>"They haven't found Mr. Forrest, then, sir?" said
the man respectfully. He was simply brimming over
with curiosity.</p>

<p>"No. I'm afraid we shall never see him alive again,"
I groaned.</p>

<p>"Dear me! Not so bad as that, I hope, sir," he
responded sympathetically, as he still lingered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not half so bad as that, Wilson," remarked a cheery
voice just outside the door.</p>

<p>My man started, and I jumped to my feet with a
shout of welcome.</p>

<p>"Forrest! Forrest!" I cried. "Come along in, man."</p>

<p>"Well, if I may?" replied Forrest's voice.</p>

<p>"If you may!" I answered. "Why&mdash;what
the&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>My astonishment at the appearance he presented as
he entered the room choked my further utterance.</p>

<p>The man who entered was a veritable scarecrow.
A man with a torn coat and rent trowsers, and a battered
hat which barely held together upon his head. He was
covered from head to foot with mud. His face was dirty,
unshaven, disreputable.</p>

<p>"Forrest? Is it indeed you?" I could not but ask,
when my speech returned to me.</p>

<p>"I don't ask you to recognize me until I have had
a bath and a shave," he replied. "But when I have
sacrificed to Hygeia, I expect to be presentable enough
to dine with Mr. Winter to-night. I've been wondering
all day whether I should manage to get here in time.
Meanwhile, the least spot of whisky&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I could not express my delight at his return, and
unthinkingly I poured out nearly a tumbler of the neat
spirit, and felt almost hurt when he returned all but one
finger to the decanter.</p>

<p>"If you give me a dose like that, I shall certainly
be unable to accompany you," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>I could curb my curiosity no longer. I burst out
with a string of questions.</p>

<p>"Where have you been? What has happened to
you? Why did you disappear? How&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped me. "So that's why you gave me all
that whisky. You wanted to make me talk, eh?"</p>

<p>I laughingly disassociated myself from any such intention,
and, putting the curb on my curiosity, I turned
him over to Wilson to be valeted out of the semblance
to a tramp.</p>

<p>The process took some time, and when he came
downstairs in irreproachable evening clothes, there was
no time for him to give me the history of his adventures
unless we were to miss our dinner.</p>

<p>"And that," declared Forrest, "I absolutely refuse to
do; for, with the exception of sixpenny worth of rum and a
crust of bread and cheese, nothing has passed my lips since
dinner last night."</p>

<p>"Then you will be glad to hear that the Winters are
punctual people," I remarked as we at once set out for my
neighbour's house.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, as we reached our destination, "I
may count upon you not referring to the plight in which
I returned to your place? I should not care for it to get
abroad that the Pirate had got the better of me on the
first occasion of our meeting."</p>

<p>"Then you have seen him?" I cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"Seen him!" Forrest ejaculated in reply. "Seen
him! After dinner you shall have a full, true and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
particular account of all that's happened. Until then&mdash;well,
assume you know everything but are not at liberty
to divulge anything."</p>

<p>I was as much at home in Winter's house as in my
own, so I did not trouble to ring and Forrest followed me
in. I had forgotten that his appearance was likely to
create as great a sensation there as it had caused me. I
entered the drawing-room first, Forrest being a little behind.
Mrs. Winter, a fluffy-haired little woman with
blue baby eyes, baby lips, and a most engaging little baby
dimple, was the centre of the party gathered there. The
other women were Miss Maitland and Mrs. Winter's
twin sister, who reproduced the hair, lips, eyes and dimple
with such exactness that it was always a puzzle to me how
Winter had managed to make up his mind between them.
About them were gathered Colonel Maitland, Mannering,
Winter himself, and another man whom he had brought
down with him from town that day. The subject of
conversation, I learned afterwards, had been entirely devoted
to Forrest's disappearance, and when they caught
sight of him the effect was electrical. The ladies all
jumped to their feet, the twin sisters screamed in unison,
the men stood stock still. Mannering appeared to be the
most astonished, for he turned pale and his lips became
livid. Before any one could say a word, however, the
door opened again and the butler announced dinner in an
impassive voice, which sent everybody into convulsions of
laughter.</p>

<p>We filed into dinner a particularly merry party. Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Winter had arranged for me to take in Miss Maitland, and
the fact that Mannering obviously resented the arrangement
added a great deal to my good humour. The fact
of Forrest being the lion of the evening did not disturb
me at all. Indeed I was glad some one else had to parry
the numberless questions put to him respecting his disappearance.</p>

<p>He fenced them remarkably well, though of course,
when cornered, he could always fall back upon the excuse
of his mouth being closed by the official pledge of secrecy.</p>

<p>Needless to say, only one topic was mooted, and I
should not have referred to it had not the man whom
Winter had brought from town said something which, I
found afterwards, had some bearing on future events.
This person was a diamond merchant in his business hours,
and after the ladies had left us, he expressed the opinion
that it was a good thing the Motor Pirate confined his
attentions to fellow motorists.</p>

<p>"If, for instance," he remarked, "he were to take it
into his head to hold up the Brighton Parcels Mail to-morrow
night, he would make one of the best-known
firms in Hatton Garden feel very sick."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Mannering, carelessly. He had
quite recovered from the temporary shock which Forrest's
unexpected appearance had occasioned him.</p>

<p>"Well, I heard they are sending off a particularly
valuable collection of stones by registered parcel post to-morrow,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"Seems a silly thing to do," commented Winter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know about that," was the reply. "Their
theory is that the chances of robbery are infinitely less
than by any other method of forwarding. They have
followed the practice for years, and hitherto have never
made a loss. You see, no one knows anything about it
except the principal, who takes the packet to the post
office. He registers it at St. Martin's, and the packet is
immediately placed amongst a number of parcels of all
sorts, shapes and sizes; and the chance of a casual thief
selecting that particular parcel, even if he had the chance,
are at least a hundred to one, while it is well known that
the postal employee who steals always lets the registered
letter severely alone."</p>

<p>The subject was not pursued further, and soon after
we joined the ladies. The party broke up early, and I
was not sorry, for I could see Forrest was tired and I
wanted to get his story from him before he turned in.
But when we were back in my snuggery, I found that he
considered it necessary to report himself at St. Albans. I
was on the telephone, so I suggested its use, and he jumped
at the idea. After some little difficulty we managed to
get a message through to the police-station. Then settling
down into an easy chair with a great sigh of content, he
reeled out an account of his adventures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>DESCRIBING A RIDE WITH THE PIRATE</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">When</span> you left me," Forrest began, "I thought I
would pass the time until your return in making a still
more detailed inspection of the ground than we had
already made. I found I had no lights. In order to get
over the difficulty, I went to the car in which the dead
man was seated and examined the lamps. They were in
good working order, and I could see that their extinction
had not been due to any mischance. Why they should
have been put out and the machinery of the car left
running puzzled me. I could only conclude that the
Pirate, after shooting his victim, had approached the car
to plunder him, but had been scared away by the sound
of our approach. He must have turned out the lights
and have just had time to draw the car across the road to
make a trap for us, before making his own escape. This
impression of mine was confirmed later. I took one of
the lamps from its socket, lit it, and looked again at the
dead body. I am almost certain he had not been
disturbed since the fated bullet struck him. His coat
was closely buttoned. His rug was wrapped tightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
round him. There were papers in his coat pocket, and
I could feel through the coat that his watch and chain
were still upon him. When thinking that the Pirate
could not be far off, I regretted I had not accompanied
you; but remembering you were well armed, I reckoned
that if you did meet the gentleman, you were quite
capable of giving a good account of yourself&mdash;and of
him."</div>

<p>You who happen to have read my account of the
state of my mind, as faithfully described in these pages,
will be able to judge how far my friend's confidence in
me was justified. For myself, I doubt not that had he
met me, the Pirate would have been able to add a second
victim to that night's list with little difficulty. This by
the way.</p>

<p>"I did not make a very close examination," continued
Forrest, "since there would be plenty of time for that
when the doctor arrived. Besides, I wished him to see
the body in the position we found it. So I turned my
attention to the road again, going over the surface inch
by inch in the most methodical manner. You never
know, you see, whether some trifling object may not be
dropped by the criminal which will provide a clue. I
was so engaged when I became aware of a curious
humming sound in the air. I stood upright and peered
into the darkness. But my eyes had become dazzled by
looking at the white road in the brilliant light of the
acetylene lamp, and I might as well have expected to be
able to see through a brick wall. The most sensible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
course to have pursued would have been to extinguish
the lamp; but, instead of doing so, I stood like a fool
in the middle of the road and waited until the Pirate&mdash;it
was he without the slightest doubt&mdash;swooped down
upon me, and if I had not at the last moment leaped
aside I should have been bowled over. As it was, I just
escaped being knocked down. The car pulled up with
a jerk, and there, within reach, was the person whose
capture would have&mdash;well, you can guess what it would
have meant to me, if I could have managed to get him
single-handed. But for the moment I was so astounded
at the audacity of the rascal I could do nothing. I was
not long in making up my mind to have a shot at
capturing him, however. I dropped the lamp to the
ground, and clipping my hand into my pocket I grasped
my revolver. I knew I had to deal with a desperate
character, but I was scarcely prepared to find him as
physically powerful as he proved to be. I stepped up
close to the car and with my left hand made a grab at
him. It was a fruitless attempt. I found my wrist held
in a grip of steel. I raised my right with the revolver.
I was just a moment late in pulling the trigger, for he
knocked up my hand and the bullet went wide. Before
I had another chance, he twisted the weapon out of my
grasp with a wrench that numbed my arm to the
shoulder. How he managed to see in the dark was a
mystery to me. He must have eyes like a cat&mdash;that man."</p>

<p>Forrest paused to light another cigarette, and after
a couple of puffs he resumed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"But the most startling thing was to come. Holding
me tightly he leaned over towards me and said, 'Not
this time, Inspector Forrest. You may think you have
the Motor Pirate, but I can assure you that you were
never more mistaken in your life.' Astonishment is not
the name for my feelings at hearing him address me by
my name. I had caught a glimpse of him before I
dropped the lamp, but he was so swathed in his leather
coat and disguised by his mask, that I should never be
able to identify him. But I seemed to recognize something
familiar in the intonation of his voice, yet even
that was so muffled that I cannot be certain I have ever
heard it before. However, I did not allow my astonishment
to prevent me taking action. I threw myself suddenly
backwards, hoping the weight of my body would
upset his balance and drag him from his car to the ground,
where we should have been on more equal terms. The
jerk moved him about as much as if he had been built
into his car. 'No, you don't, Inspector,' he said, with an
infernal chuckle; and, so saying, he leaned over and,
catching me by the coat, lifted me off my feet and
swung me up on to the car before him. I'm not a light
weight, as you can guess&mdash;I turn the scale at something
nearer twelve stone than eleven&mdash;but he handled me as if
I were a baby. I struggled of course, but my right arm
was powerless, and he could master me with ease."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was during the struggle that you lost
the two buttons from your overcoat which you left
behind you?" I asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most likely," he replied, "though I knew nothing
of them. Really his strength seemed diabolic. There
was something else about him which to my mind scarcely
seemed natural. At all my struggles he continued to
laugh, but there was no merriment in his laughter, it
was merely an even guttural cachinnation, the laugh of
a fiend at the aimless struggles of a lost soul. It seemed
to give him immense pleasure to see me wriggling on the
smooth curved metal plate which formed the front of his
car. I grew tired at last and lay still, hoping for a
chance to better my position, for I came to the conclusion
that in a mere trial of strength he was immeasurably my
superior.</p>

<p>"When he saw my resistance had ceased, he spoke
again. 'I feel inclined to take you for a ride with me,
Inspector,' he said. 'I can assure you that you will find
the experience a thrilling one. It is given to few men
to travel with the Motor Pirate. The pace alone should
prove exhilarating, to say nothing of the companionship
and&mdash;what awaits you at the termination of the entertainment.'
He chuckled again as he concluded, and I
felt a cold thrill in the region of my spine.</p>

<p>"I made no reply. What would have been the
use? But I do wish my right arm had been of some
use, for I think in my anger I might have stood some
chance of turning the tables on him. I quietly tried
to rub the feeling back into it, but he did not afford me
a chance of doing so for long. He produced a length of
rope from somewhere or other, and, before I gathered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
what he was doing, he had twisted it round me and
bound my arms tightly to my sides. I was absolutely
powerless, and I gnashed my teeth with rage at the
helpless state in which I found myself. There was I,
a detective inspector with a reputation at the Yard second
to none, trussed like a fowl, and lying on the slippery
surface of the Pirate car I had come out to capture."</p>

<p>"Not exactly a pleasant position," I remarked, as
Forrest paused to moisten his throat with the whisky-and-soda
at his elbow.</p>

<p>"No; but the worst was yet to come. He had no
sooner secured my arms than he drew another piece of
cord through the band, and fastened it somewhere or
other. 'Now, if ever you pray, Inspector,' he remarked,
with some more of his beastly merriment, 'pray that
this rope doesn't break; for if it should happen to do
so at the pace we shall be travelling, you will go to hell
even sooner than I intend you to do.'</p>

<p>"With that he set his car in motion, and, judging
by the way the wind stung me, the pace was something
terrific. At first I attempted to pay some attention to
the direction we took. But I soon gave up the idea. My
position on the car was not one from which I could observe
anything with any degree of comfort. With my arms
bound, I sprawled out upon the smooth, curved bonnet
of the confounded car, only held on by a cord which
I expected to break and send me flying into the next
world every time we touched a stone, or crossed a rut.
My heart was in my mouth for the next hour or so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
but afterwards I think I grew careless or callous. He
had pulled the cord round my arms pretty tightly; that
numbed me all over, and the exposure to the air did
the rest. I fell into a dreamy condition. I only know
that never for a moment were we still. There was
always the drone of the wheels in my ears, and whenever
I made a struggle and opened my eyes, all I could see
was the blacker streak in the blackness caused by the
hedges flying past. Heaven only knows how far and
where we went. It seemed an eternity until it ended.
But by then I was very near unconsciousness. I have
a sort of impression the car did stop. I fancy that I
saw the Pirate's mask bent closely over me while he
examined me, that I heard him say, 'I don't think,
Mr. Inspector, your attentions will trouble me much
more.' I do remember distinctly being lifted in his
powerful hands. I felt him swing me once, twice, thrice;
then I felt myself flying in the air, and the next moment
my senses came back to me with a rush, for I plumped
into several feet of water."</p>

<p>"Well?" I ejaculated, as Forrest paused to light
another cigarette. I was so interested that I grudged
him a moment's delay before completing the story.</p>

<p>"The curious thing to my mind is that he did not
knock me on the head at first," said Forrest. "I can
only explain it by the conclusion that our friend the
Motor Pirate is a madman. But, if so, I undoubtedly
owe my life to the means he took to finish it. The
sudden immersion brought me to myself much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
rapidly than any other process could have done. In
detaching me from the car he must have loosened the
knot of the rope binding my arms; possibly the water
made it slip further before it became saturated. I felt
the rope give, and got one arm free by the time I came
to the surface. I floundered into shallow water, and
paused. By this time there was just a glimmer of light
on the eastern horizon from the dawn, and I could see
the bank was only a yard or two distant. Somehow
or another I managed to scramble out, bringing half the
bed of the river, or pond, whichever it was I had been
pitched into, with me. When I was on firm ground
I collapsed. I did not remain long on the ground,
though. I knew very well that if I wanted to escape
a severe illness, the only thing to do was to keep moving
until my circulation was restored. So I got going. It
was hard work at first. My limbs were so cramped
and stiff that I was compelled to stop and groan after
crawling every six paces. But the stiffness wore off
gradually. I went ahead until I struck a village, and
found out in what part of the country I was."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go to the police-station?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Wasn't going to make myself a laughing-stock for
a lot of country constables," he answered. "No; if
I had got my man, I should not have minded what sort
of figure I cut, but to turn up such a scarecrow after
failing to get my man&mdash;not much. I had learned from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>the post-office window where I was. I had been
dropped near Shefford, a village a few miles the other
side of Hitchin on the North Road, and I thought if
I walked back here I should avoid all likelihood of getting
a chill. So I started. I found I had a shilling in my
pocket. I had more money about me than that when
I started out, but whether our friend helped himself to
the balance, or whether it fell from my pockets during
the ride, I haven't the slightest idea. But the shilling
was sufficient to provide for my requirements. The
first public-house I found open I went in, and had six-penny-worth
of hot rum. My word! There's nothing
like hot rum for putting new life into one. After I
had drunk it I reckoned I should get here about noon;
but I had not taken the somniferous effects of that
sixpenny-worth of rum into the calculation. Before I
had covered half a dozen miles, I found myself so sleepy
that I could not keep my eyes open. I dropped off
once or twice as I walked, so at last I made for a convenient
haystack, rolled myself up in the loose litter at
the base, and let myself go.</p>

<p>"That's how it happened I was so late in my
arrival," he remarked; "and now, Motor Pirate or
no Motor Pirate, I am going to finish that snooze."</p>

<p>He gave a prodigious yawn, and held out his hand.
"Good night!" I said. "The story of my adventures
will very well keep until to-morrow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH THE PIRATE HOLDS UP THE BRIGHTON MAIL</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>On</span> joining Forrest at breakfast the following morning,
I found he had mapped out a programme for the day
which promised to keep us pretty busily occupied.</div>

<p>"First," he said, "I must get into St. Albans, and
see whether there is any fresh information to hand. If
possible, I should like to run over to Shefford, for I want
to look at the place where I had my ducking, and recover
the piece of cord with which that almighty scoundrel
secured me. Then there's the inquest at Towcester at
twelve, and sometime to-day I must put in an appearance
at head-quarters to hand in my report. Perhaps I had
better train from Towcester for that. It will be making
too great demands on your time."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I replied; "I can run you up to town
very nearly as quickly as you could manage the journey
by rail."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't have to return alone," he remarked.
"I am hoping to be able to inflict myself upon
you for a few more days; but it is on the cards I may be
taken off the job since I have met with so little success."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope not," I answered.</p>

<p>"I should be sorry, too," he said. "I am more
convinced than ever that our friend is living within a
twenty-mile radius of this house."</p>

<p>"What grounds have you for thinking so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The very slightest at present," he declared frankly;
"and until I have seen the police reports from other
parts of the country, I will not commit myself definitely
to the opinion."</p>

<p>I could not get anything more out of him then, but
after he had made a note of all the information to be
obtained at St. Albans&mdash;we were on the road by nine-thirty&mdash;he
became more communicative. The information
he obtained did not amount to much. On the previous
evening, the Motor Pirate had not made his appearance
anywhere; while on the evening before, the only outrage
of which he had been guilty was the murder which we
had discovered. On that night, however, his car had
been reported as having been seen on various roads in
the midlands, one appearance having been recorded as
far north as Peterborough.</p>

<p>"That confirms my opinion," Forrest declared.
"The Peterborough report gives the time of his
appearance as about 2.50. The sun rises at five, and it
is beginning to be light an hour earlier. It must have
been about four when he dropped me into the water at
Shefford. Hitherto he has not been seen by daylight at
all. Clearly he must have delayed getting rid of me
until he thought it was dangerous to carry me about any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
longer. He may even have been close to his own home,
though he would probably select a spot twenty or
thirty miles away at least."</p>

<p>"It seems likely," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Certain of it," said Forrest. "Now we will get
along to Shefford."</p>

<p>We had a very pleasant run, and a mile from the
village, Forrest stopped me where a deep pool fringed
with rushes skirted the road.</p>

<p>"This is the spot," he cried.</p>

<p>He left me in the car and scrambled through the
hedge into an adjoining field. He came running back
with a dilapidated overcoat sodden with water in one hand,
and a piece of rope in the other.</p>

<p>"Thought I could not be mistaken," he cried.</p>

<p>When he was again in the car he examined the rope
carefully.</p>

<p>"Just an ordinary piece of half-inch cord," he remarked.
"It's not of much value as a clue, but as a
piece of evidence&mdash;I have known a man's life hang upon
a slighter thread before now." He chuckled grimly at
his own pleasantry.</p>

<p>"Where next?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Towcester," he replied; and I wheeled the car
round, and we were soon making the dust fly again.</p>

<p>We were not detained very long at the inquest.
Forrest had a few words with the coroner, so that after
formal evidence of identification had been given, and I
had made my statement as to the finding of the body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the inquiry was adjourned. Thus plenty of time was
left at our disposal, and we did not hurry on our way to
town, even breaking our journey on the way for lunch.</p>

<p>The weather remained delightfully fine. Clean
roads, blue sky, soft winds, combined to make ideal
weather for motoring. We reached town about four,
and went straight to Scotland Yard. Forrest went in
while I waited for him. Then he returned for me, and,
taking me up in the lift, he piloted me into the presence
of the commissioner, whom I found to be an exceedingly
courteous gentleman. He expressed himself indebted to
me for the assistance I had rendered the department. I
did not see that my assistance had been of much practical
value, and I said so; but I added that I was very keen
on the Motor Pirate's capture, and I should be glad to
render any service in my power which would tend to
such an end.</p>

<p>"Anything you can do to assist Inspector Forrest will
be greatly appreciated," he declared. "Of course, it is
not our usual plan to make use of outside assistance, but
we are not so bound up in red tape as to refuse such aid
as that you offer."</p>

<p>We had ten minutes' further conversation, and then
Forrest and I left together. The detective was in high
glee. He had obtained <i>carte blanche</i> to do as he liked.
His chief had expressed every confidence in him, while
urging him to spare no effort to obtain the Pirate's
arrest.</p>

<p>"The fact is," he said, "the papers have been rubbing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it into us for allowing such audacious crimes to be committed
right under our noses, and the chief is wild to
get the chap. Half of the detective force are already
engaged on the job. I fancy I should get him myself
singlehanded sooner or later if he were a sane man; but,
as it is, the cunning of a madman upsets every calculation."</p>

<p>"You still hold to the theory that he is mad?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Cannot explain his treatment of me in any other
way," he replied promptly.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the next move?" I asked, when we
had returned to our car. "I suppose we may as well go
for a prowl to-night, on the off-chance of finding him."</p>

<p>"We might try a new district," answered Forrest,
"You may have noticed that he breaks fresh ground
every time he reappears."</p>

<p>"Where shall it be then?"</p>

<p>Forrest answered my question with another. "Supposing
yourself to be in his place, and the desire to
attract notoriety a stronger motive than mere plunder.
What should you do?"</p>

<p>There flashed into my memory what Winter's guest
had said about the Brighton Parcels Mail, and I said
laughingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I fancy I should hold up the Brighton Mail."</p>

<p>"As likely a feat as any for him to attempt," replied
Forrest, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>I glanced up at the clock in the tower of St. Stephens;
the hands pointed to a quarter before five.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," I said, "we may as well run down to
Brighton by daylight and get acquainted with the road,
since I have only driven over it once before. We can
dine at the Metropole comfortably, spend a couple of
hours on the front after dinner, and have plenty of time
to meet the mail on the road afterwards."</p>

<p>"A most excellent suggestion," agreed the inspector,
and his eyes twinkled at the thought of the programme
I had mapped out.</p>

<p>We started forthwith. Reaching Brighton before
sunset, I refilled my tanks with petrol before putting the
car up at the Metropole and reserving a table for
dinner. We had a wash, walked to the Hove end of
the esplanade, and came back to our dinner with appetites
equal to anything. We sat over our coffee a long while,
Forrest making the time fly by spinning yarns about his
experiences. Then we smoked a cigar on the pier, and
so whiled away the time until eleven. If we had started
then we should possibly have reached town before the
mail had started, but as we were both tired of dawdling
about, I proposed that we should extend our tour.</p>

<p>Forrest was quite agreeable. "Really we are out
on a fool's errand," he remarked. "We are just as
likely to meet him on one road as another. Yet I have
a presentiment that we shall hear something further about
him to-night. If we do meet him, remember one thing.
One of us must get in the first shot, and it must not
miss."</p>

<p>"Don't wait for me to shoot, then," I replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>We got our car, and after a glance at the map, I told
my companion where I proposed to go: a run along the
coast to Worthing, there to strike inland for Horsham,
from Horsham to make for the Brighton road about
Crawley, roughly about a forty-mile run in all, and I
reckoned that if we kept to the legal speed limit we
should just about meet the mail.</p>

<p>Forrest made no objection to my suggestion, so we
started at our slowest pace. I had very little to do, and
the ride was one of the most enjoyable I have ever
experienced. The salt breath of the sea was in our faces,
and the roar of it in our ears. I was quite sorry when
on reaching Worthing it became necessary to leave
the coast. Inland the roads were absolutely deserted.
We did not meet a single person between Worthing and
Horsham, and for the first time I realized how easily the
Motor Pirate's movements could evade notice. At
Horsham we looked in at the police-station, and Forrest
made a formal inquiry as to whether anything had been
heard of our quarry in the neighbourhood; but, as we
expected, without result. We remained there a little
time to stretch our legs and to drink a cup of tea, which
the officer in charge prepared for us, and on leaving we
proceeded at the same steady pace, arriving in Crawley
something after four. There we found that the mail
had passed through a quarter of an hour before our
arrival, and I questioned whether it would be worth our
while to remain any longer on the road.</p>

<p>"We may as well make a night of it," said Forrest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in reply to my remark on the subject, so I turned the
car in the direction of Brighton again. We bowled
along at about fifteen miles an hour, at which rate I
reckoned on catching the mail within half an hour. But
we were destined to overtake it in a considerably shorter
time, for just after passing the third milestone after
leaving the village, our path was blocked by the huge
van standing in the middle of the road and all across it.</p>

<p>I pulled up at once. Apparently the vehicle was not
much damaged, but the door was broken open, while
the parcels with which it had been laden were scattered
all over the roadway. One horse lay on the roadway
perfectly still, the others had disappeared.</p>

<p>The moment we stopped Forrest leaped from the
car; I followed his example. The first object which
met our eyes was the form of a man. He lay perfectly
still, and I thought he was dead, but my companion had
sharper eyes. Taking a knife from his pocket, he hacked
at cords which bound the man hand and foot.</p>

<p>"More work of the Motor Pirate," remarked Forrest
grimly, as I came to his assistance.</p>

<p>The man was not dead, but he had been so roughly
gagged that had we arrived ten minutes later he probably
would have been beyond human help. In the condition
he was, it took us ten minutes working vigorously to
restore his respiration; and after that it took the whole
of the contents of my pocket flask to restore him sufficiently
to enable him to give us an account of the mishap
which had befallen him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we learned that the man was the driver of the
mail, and that Forrest's surmise that we had happened
once more upon the handiwork of the Motor Pirate was
correct. He had, it appeared, been driving quietly along,
when his attention had been arrested by the curious
high-toned hum which presaged the Pirate's approach.
He was wondering what the curious noise could be,
when he suddenly realized that a long low car was beside
him. He did not anticipate any harm either to himself
or to his charge, for, though he fancied that the stranger
was the noted criminal, he shared the impression, pretty
common until then, that the Pirate confined his attentions
to motorists. The stranger did not even call upon
him to pull up. He ran beside the coach, then slightly
increasing his speed, he drew level with the wheelers of
the team. There was the sound of a pistol shot, the
off wheeler fell dead in his tracks, bringing down the
other horses in his fall, and swinging the vehicle right
across the road. The driver only escaped being pitched
from his seat by the strap which held him to it.</p>

<p>"Then," continued the man, "he ups with 'is pistol
an' tells me to come dahn, an' dahn I toddles pretty
quick. 'Sorry ter inconwenience yer, my good feller,'
ee says. 'Don't menshing it,' I says, as perlite as you'd
be with a pistol a pointing at yer 'ed. 'I want the keys
er this 'ere waggin,' ee says. 'Sorry they don't trust
'em ter us drivers,' I answers. 'Don't matter worth
a cent,' ee says. 'I've another w'y er openin' thet
strong box. Put yer 'ands be'ind yer an' turn rahnd,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
ee says. I done it, an' ee trusses me up like a bloomin'
chicken, an' sticks my own angkincher dahn me froat.
With thet ee walks along ter the door and blows the
bloomin' locks orf with 'is pistol. That did it. Ee
looks inside, an' the w'y ee cleared them parcels aht was
a sight&mdash;well, yer can see fer yerself wort it's like. The
other 'orses were thet mad they kicks theirselves free.
Ee goes froo the parcels cool as a cowcumber until ee
routs aht the registered parcels. Ee puts them in 'is car.
'Tar, tar!' ee says, wiving 'is 'and, an' orf ee goes jest
abaht five minutes afore you gents comed along."</p>

<p>When Forrest realized how near we had been to
coming to close quarters with our quarry, he went aside,
and for the first time since I had made his acquaintance, I
heard him swear. It was a successful effort. He returned
to my side the next moment.</p>

<p>"The telegraph is our only chance," he said. "Drive
like hell back to Crawley."</p>

<p>I did. There we set the wires throbbing, and begun
to scour the countryside for any traces of the Pirate.
We did not give up our quest until eleven o'clock in the
morning. I think we inquired at every house and cottage
within a ten-mile radius of the scene of the outrage, but
without finding a single person who had seen or heard
of the Motor Pirate.</p>

<p>Once more he had appeared and disappeared without
leaving the faintest clue to his identity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>HOW WE EXCHANGE SHOTS WITH THE PIRATE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">After</span> the sudden flurry which the reappearance of the
Motor Pirate caused, and quite as much in the country
at large as in my own particular circle, we settled down
once again to a condition of comparative quietude. Of
course there were plenty of facts to keep the public
interest alive and to fill the papers. The adjourned
inquest on the victim found near Towcester supplied
columns of copy, while the robbery of the Brighton Mail
afforded unlimited scope for the descriptive reporter as
well as for the special crime investigator, who at this
time made his permanent appearance on the staff of
nearly every paper of any importance in the British
Isles. My life at home was made a burden to me by
these gentlemen. I bear them no malice for their
persevering attempts to interview me, but they were an
unmitigated nuisance, since I had no wish to air my
experiences in the newspapers at this stage of affairs.
It was with the utmost difficulty I escaped the attention
of the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate, for they even
waited on my doorstep for the chance of button-holing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
me when I went out in the morning; and pursued me
so assiduously, that I dared not look a stranger in the
face, lest my glance should be translated into a column
of glowing prose.</div>

<p>I have said that the Pirate left no clue to his identity
upon his latest appearance, and, indeed, at the time, such
was the opinion both of Forrest and myself. But in the
light of after events we learned that there was a clue,
had we been keen-witted enough to have discovered it.
In the course of our inquiries around Crawley, we
certainly did not succeed in finding any one who had
observed the mysterious car which every one had learned
to associate with the Pirate, but we had been told
casually at Caterham&mdash;we had not returned by the
direct road between London and Brighton&mdash;that we
were not the only motorists abroad on that night, since
another man had passed through the town early the
same morning. When we learned, however, that he
had been driving a car of the conventional shape with
a tonneau body, we paid no further attention to the
information, concluding that he was a sportsman, anxious
like ourselves for a brush with the Pirate. Our blindness
was to cost us dear before we had done.</p>

<p>There was another supposition which I could not
get out of my mind in connection with the latest feat,
and a couple of days afterwards I mentioned it to Forrest
as we waited, according to our invariable custom, at
St. Albans for news of the Pirate's reappearance.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it particularly strange," I remarked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
"that in holding up the Brighton Mail, our friend at
once searched for the registered parcels, and directly he
laid his hands upon them at once made off?"</p>

<p>"A perfectly natural thing for him to do," replied
the detective. "He would guess that, if there were any
valuables, they would almost certainly have been registered,
and he could scarcely hope to go over the whole contents
of the van."</p>

<p>"Admitted," I replied. "Still, does it not strike you
as curious that he should have selected the night when
a valuable parcel of diamonds was there?"</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Forrest, his attention thoroughly
arrested.</p>

<p>"It almost seems as if he was possessed of the same
information as we were," I ventured.</p>

<p>"According to your argument," he answered, "the
pirate should be either yourself or myself, Colonel Maitland,
Mr. Mannering, Mr. Winter, or his friend."</p>

<p>"There remains Mannering and the diamond
merchant," I said thoughtfully, "and I know the latter
has never driven a motor-car in his life. Besides, he is
scarcely likely to have robbed himself in such an extraordinary
fashion." We had seen from the papers that
he had, in fact, been referring to his own firm when he
had described to us the advantages of the parcel post as
a means of transmitting valuables. "He may have other
friends beside Winter to whom he has mentioned the
matter."</p>

<p>"There's Mr. Mannering still to be accounted for,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
remarked Forrest. "No harm can be done by inquiring
if he was away from home that evening. What sort
of establishment does he keep?"</p>

<p>"Merely a couple of maids," I answered.</p>

<p>"In that case there should be no trouble in ascertaining
whether he was out or not," he replied. "I'll see
about it in the morning."</p>

<p>He made the inquiry accordingly, but as he confessed
to me afterwards, without expecting anything to come of
it. His expectations seemed to be justified in the result.
The maids declared that Mannering had gone to his
sitting-room after dinner, and had been there with his
slippers on when they retired for the night. They had
locked up the house as usual, and the doors had been
fast when they came down the next morning.</p>

<p>This investigation, perfunctory as it was, decided us
against any idea of Mannering's complicity, and I fell
back upon the theory that the diamond merchant must
have communicated his methods to some one else. We
sought him out in the city, and he assured us that he
had never before referred to the subject. He did not
object to supplying us with the names of his acquaintances
who owned cars, and either Forrest or myself
made inquiries concerning every one of them. All were
to no purpose. When we had finished, we were no
nearer discovering anything concerning the Pirate than
we were when we had begun.</p>

<p>Then occurred an incident which should have opened
our eyes, if anything possibly could have done so, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
personality of the Pirate. But again we were absolutely
blind.</p>

<p>It was the second week of May, and since, in spite
of continued fine weather, our unknown terror remained
in the seclusion of his hiding-place, wherever it might
be, I had persuaded Forrest to come with me for a run
one afternoon as far as Cambridge, proposing to return
after sunset.</p>

<p>The roads were beginning to be a little dusty, but
altogether we had a very pleasant journey without any
incident of note. We left the university town about
nine, reckoning upon getting home comfortably before
midnight. There was a bright slice of moon shining,
and we did the dozen miles before reaching Royston at
a decent pace. We went slowly over the hilly road
out of Royston and had passed over the worst of it, and
I had just put on a higher speed, when I fancied I heard
the distant hum which once heard could never be
mistaken for anything else. Forrest heard it at the
same time as myself.</p>

<p>"Pull up at the side of the road," he cried. "The
car must not be damaged."</p>

<p>I obeyed, running the bonnet into the hedge and
leaving the back of the car extended over the footpath.
Meanwhile, Forrest had drawn his revolver from his
pocket, and the moment I brought the car to a standstill
I followed his example.</p>

<p>"Don't stand on ceremony," advised my companion;
"shoot on sight!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when our
enemy made his appearance, coming from the direction
of Buntingford. Whether he had any intention of
stopping and robbing us, I have no means of telling, but
I think not, for he was travelling at his most rapid pace,
and gave no signs of slackening as he approached. Once
more I was astonished at the wonderful steadiness of his
machine. He passed us in a flash, the car running as
evenly as if it were upon rails. In fact I paid so much
attention to this, that I was too late to fire with any
prospect of hitting him. Forrest was more alert. As
the Pirate swooped by, the detective's Colt spoke twice.
So far as we could see, the shots took no effect, for he
did not move an inch.</p>

<p>"No luck," muttered my companion, as the hum
of the Pirate's car died away in the distance.</p>

<p>I held up a warning finger. "Hush!" I said.</p>

<p>My ears had told me truly&mdash;our enemy was once
more approaching us. I leaned over the back of the car,
this time determined that I would at least make an endeavour
to stop his progress. The road was without a
bend for a stretch of at least two hundred yards, and the
moment he came into the straight he was clearly visible to
us in the light of the moon. I did not wait. The moment
I saw him distinctly, I lifted my revolver and pulled the
trigger as rapidly as I was able. Before I had emptied
three chambers he was level. I was just in the act of
firing a third time, when a flash of fire spurted from
the running car and my pistol dropped from my hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Something had struck me violently on the arm. I felt
no pain for the moment, only curiously numbed and
cold. I wondered why my companion should continue
to fire at the rapidly disappearing form of the Pirate, who
appeared to me to be swerving from side to side of the
road in the most ridiculous fashion. In another moment
he was out of sight. I felt extremely sick, and, with
something between a groan and a sigh, I sank back into
my seat.</p>

<p>"I fancy one of us must have got him," said Forrest,
in an excited tone. "Let us get on."</p>

<p>"I hope you are right," I answered. "For he has
certainly managed to wing me."</p>

<p>The shock had passed off, and, with the return of
sensation, my arm felt as if a red-hot iron had been run
through it, while there was a similar sort of feeling about
my chest.</p>

<p>"Really," said Forrest, as he looked closely into my
face. He must have seen that I was not joking, for he
jumped out of the car and came back with one of the
lamps in his hand. "Where is it?" he asked, with
some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Merely the arm, I fancy," I replied.</p>

<p>He took a knife from his pocket, and, without a
moment's hesitation, ripped up the sleeve of the overcoat
and under-coat which I was wearing. The shirtsleeve
was already soaked with blood, and his face was
curiously anxious as he cut away the linen and felt the
bone from wrist to shoulder. Then his face cleared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only through the muscle," he remarked. "A
fortnight will see the wound completely healed."</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was tearing his handkerchief into
strips, and, with this improvised bandage, he bound up
the wound.</p>

<p>"Sure that is all?" he asked, when he had tightened
it to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I've got much the same sort of feeling here," I
replied, tapping my chest gingerly.</p>

<p>His face grew grave again, and before doing anything
more he fished my flask out of my pocket, and insisted
upon my taking a liberal draught of the contents. Not
until then would he examine me.</p>

<p>"Your bleeding powers would do credit to a
bullock," he commented, as he cut away my shirt:
"but beyond loss of blood, I don't think there's much
harm done."</p>

<p>His first impression was correct. A cursory examination
was quite sufficient to convince him that I was
not much hurt.</p>

<p>"Just a nasty furrow," he remarked. "Pretty painful,
I suppose. The bullet glanced off, turned by that
leather coat of yours, I presume. Lucky for you; as it
is, you will be all right in the fortnight."</p>

<p>I felt relieved by his tone, and assured him, when
he had patched me up temporarily with strips torn from
my shirt-sleeves and my own handkerchief, that I felt
very little of the injury.</p>

<p>"Now take my seat," he said, as he buttoned my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
coat round me. "I think I have had enough experience
of motoring to ensure my taking you in safety to the
nearest surgeon. It's infernally bad luck, though," he
continued. "I would swear one of us must have hit
our friend, and if we were only in a position to follow
him up, we should be pretty certain to effect a
capture."</p>

<p>My mind had been considerably relieved to find that
I was not seriously injured, and the dose of whisky I had
taken had pulled me together.</p>

<p>"You've bound me up pretty tightly?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You are right enough until we find a doctor," he
answered.</p>

<p>"In that case," I said, "if there's any chance of our
catching our man to-night, I'm not going to chuck it away.
Put the light back and let us get on."</p>

<p>My mind was made up on the subject. One reason
was that physical pain always makes me feel mad, and I
would have given a great deal to get even with the Pirate
for that reason alone. Besides, call it vanity or what you
will, I wasn't going to let any one say I had allowed a
scratch to bowl me over. So the moment Forrest had
replaced the light, I resumed my seat in the car, asserting
that I was fully capable of driving.</p>

<p>The detective attempted to dissuade me from the
attempt, but I was bent upon having my own way. He
did not argue the question at any length, for as soon as he
was in the car I backed into the middle of the road and
jammed on our highest speed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>In three minutes we were at Buntingford, and there
we nearly ran into a group of people who were gathered
in the middle of the road. They were discussing, as it
happened, the appearance of the Pirate, who had passed
through the town twenty minutes previously. Here
Forrest made another futile attempt to persuade me to see
a surgeon immediately, but I would not listen to him.
We swept onward. I could scarcely see, but I sent the
Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s along recklessly, stopping for nothing until we
reached Ware. I would never have driven in the manner
I did in calmer moments. Forrest told me afterwards
that his journey on the Pirate's car was nothing to it, for
the car rocked so from side to side of the road that he was
never certain whether I was not steering for the hedges;
while at every bend his heart was in his mouth when he
realized that the wheels were never on the ground together.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of Ware we learned that the Pirate
had been seen approaching the town, but that, instead of
passing through the narrow streets, he had doubled back
in the direction of Stevenage. He had kept his twenty
minutes' start and I was for following him. Forrest was
of another opinion.</p>

<p>"According to his usual custom, he is obviously avoiding
the towns," he argued; "and if, as I still suspect, his
hiding-place is in the vicinity of St. Albans, we shall stand
some chance of cutting him off if we take the most direct
route. He cannot be badly hurt, or we should have
picked him up before this, and under any other circumstance
we are not likely to overtake him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw the force of his reasoning and we flew on. We
heard nothing of him neither in Hertford nor in Hatfield.</p>

<p>"Our only chance is at St. Albans," remarked my
companion, and once more I put my car to top speed.</p>

<p>We were just about half way between the two towns
when we saw the lights of a motor ahead. I sounded the
horn, or rather Forrest did, but the vehicle made no
attempt to get out of the way. We caught up to the
stranger hand over fist, and not until we were nearly
touching did I slacken speed.</p>

<p>As I did so the occupant of the car shouted out,
"That you, Sutgrove? Never more pleased to meet
with a friend in my life."</p>

<p>It was Mannering.</p>

<p>"Seen anything of the Pirate?" shouted Forrest, by
way of reply.</p>

<p>"Merely had the pleasure of exchanging shots with
him ten minutes ago," was the astounding answer.
"Unfortunately he appears to have got the better of the
exchange, for he has managed to put a bullet in my
shoulder."</p>

<p>"We have had a similar experience, and Mr. Sutgrove
is the victim," answered Forrest. "So I am afraid I cannot
offer much assistance."</p>

<p>"I think I can get to St. Albans all right," he replied.
"It's only the left, and I managed to get a handkerchief
round it."</p>

<p>"If you will let us pass," I said, "I will run on to St
Albans and see that assistance is sent to you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't notice I was taking all the road," he
remarked, as he drew aside.</p>

<p>Once more we drove ahead at our speed limit, and five
minutes later we stopped before the police office. There
we found every one in blissful ignorance of the fact that
the Pirate was abroad. Nor did any one else see him
that night. Again he had mysteriously vanished under
circumstances which convinced the detective more firmly
than ever that his retreat was somewhere in the vicinity
of my home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>OF THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING WOUNDED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>I suppose</span> I must have lost more blood than I had
reckoned upon, or else the excitement of the pursuit
had been sufficient to keep me going; but whichever it
was, no sooner had we pulled up than I collapsed. I
was never nearer fainting in my life. In fact I had to
take another stiff dose of whisky, and even then I was
only too glad to relinquish the steering-wheel to Forrest,
and let him drive me the rest of the way home. He
never left me until I was safely in bed, and the surgeon
he had summoned had stitched me up.</div>

<p>Fortunately my wounds proved, as Forrest had foretold,
more painful than dangerous. The bullet had
carried with it some shreds of cloth; and the removal
of these from my arm was the only really painful bit
of work the surgeon had to perform. However, the
medical man insisted upon my remaining in bed, and
I obeyed his orders for a couple of days; but on the
third I felt so well that I rebelled against any further confinement,
and though still considerably sore, I managed
to get out and about.</p>

<p>I found I was a little bit shaky, yet I managed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
get as far as Colonel Mainland's house, and there I found
my adventure had been a blessing in disguise, for I could
see from the manner in which she greeted me, that my
last encounter with the Pirate had wiped from Miss
Maitland's memory all remembrance of the previous
occasion. There was only one thing to mar my enjoyment
of the situation thus created. Mannering had unfortunately
been successful in making himself a candidate
for similar solicitude. His injury, however, was even
more trivial than mine, the bullet having merely scored
his shoulder. I wished devoutly it had missed him
altogether, or been a few inches higher and more to
the right; for in such case I should have had Miss
Maitland's undivided sympathies and attention, whereas I
had perforce to share them with my rival. I knew I had
done nothing heroic; but if Mannering had not been hit
I might at least have posed as half a hero, instead of which
I had to be content with being a quarter of one.</p>

<p>However, I made the most of what glory I had
earned, and I am bound to confess that I traded upon
my sore arm in the most shameless fashion.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Motor Pirate at this time entered
upon a long period of quiescence, so that I was free to
make the most of my opportunity, and to devote the
whole of my time to Miss Maitland's society. The
detective was firmly of the opinion that this prolonged rest
was due to one of our shots having found its billet, and
declared that we should hear nothing more of him until
he had repaired damages. The inaction, however, soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
became very wearisome to him; and when a fortnight had
elapsed without a single appearance having been chronicled,
he became quite morose. By that time he had searched
over the whole district, but not a trace of any other injured
person could he discover; and he was as much at a
loss for a clue to the identity of the Pirate as he had been
when he first entered upon the job of running him to earth.</p>

<p>The Press by this time had nothing but jeers for the
police and for the detective force generally. Meantime
the most extraordinary steps were taken to secure the
Pirate's arrest when he should renew his career. The
Automobile Club had officially lent their assistance to
the police, and night by night the principal roads of the
county were patrolled by the members of the club, thirsting
for the opportunity of distinguishing themselves by
the capture of the marauder. The Pirate must have
been vastly amused in his retirement as he read of the
sensation he had created. I rather think that the man
in the street looked upon the whole matter as the great
sporting event of the century, and his sympathies were
undoubtedly with the man who could so easily snap his
fingers at the army of police, amateur and professional,
who were engaged in the task of seeking him. In fact,
if he had not committed the murder at Towcester, I am
convinced that the public would have elevated him to the
position of a great popular hero. Even as it was,
he had no lack of apologists; and an eminent ballad-monger
celebrated his exploits in some verses, which
were immensely applauded when recited by long-haired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
enthusiasts at smoking concerts and similar gatherings.
All this was gall to Forrest; and at last one day, three
weeks after our encounter with the Pirate, he told me
he could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"I must try another line of country," he remarked.</p>

<p>"What line do you propose?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The only thing I can think of," he replied, "is
to make inquiries in Amsterdam, to see if the diamonds
which were taken from the mail, have been offered for
sale. I am quite certain they have not been put upon
the market this side of the water."</p>

<p>I was very loth to let him go alone; but he would
not hear of my accompanying him.</p>

<p>"What! run away now, and let your friend
Mannering have a clear field? I wouldn't if I were
you," he remarked. "Besides, I can manage this sort
of work better by myself."</p>

<p>His final argument was conclusive, and he went
away promising to look me up immediately he returned,
and expressing the hope that nothing more would be
heard of the Pirate until his return.</p>

<p>On the very same day it happened that Mannering
also took his departure from St. Stephens. I had
mentioned in his hearing that Forrest had been called
away, and he had then informed us&mdash;Miss Maitland and
myself&mdash;that he had some business in Paris in connection
with the patent tyre with which he was still experimenting,
which would entail his absence for two or three days.</p>

<p>I sincerely trusted that his business would require a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
much longer period to transact; and as he was leaving
by an early train the next morning, I took particular
care he should obtain no opportunity for a private leave-taking
with Miss Maitland.</p>

<p>It was not a sporting thing to do, perhaps, but I was
so much in earnest about my love-making, that I had no
scruples about spoiling as many of my rival's chances as I
could. However, as it happened, I found somewhat to
my surprise that my tactics were not unwelcome to Miss
Maitland. She confessed as much to me the next day.
She&mdash;&mdash; But perhaps it will be better for me to give in
some detail the conversation we had upon this occasion,
since it had a considerable bearing upon after events.</p>

<p>The morning after Mannering had departed was as
brilliant a one as June ever bestowed upon mortal. Now
that my rival was out of the way, I thought I might
dispense with the sling which I had worn hitherto, and
directly after breakfast I strolled across to the Maitlands',
with the intention of persuading Miss Maitland to come
for a ride on the Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s. I found her on the point of
starting for a stroll, with the object of giving her favourite
Irish setter a run, and I was easily persuaded to abandon
my projected ride and accompany her instead. We <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'choose'">chose</ins>
the footpath between St. Stephen's church and the village
of Park Street, and, stepping out briskly, we soon reached
our destination; and as my companion would not hear
of turning back, we continued our walk to Bricket
Wood. There I insisted upon resting.</p>

<p>I had never seen her in higher spirits than she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that morning. She bubbled over with gaiety. So much
so that I could not help commenting upon the fact.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied frankly, in answer to my remarks
on the subject, "I do feel gay this morning. I feel as if
a load had been removed from my shoulders."</p>

<p>"Surely you can have no troubles," I remarked, half-banteringly.</p>

<p>A shadow alighted for a moment upon her face and
was gone again.</p>

<p>"Nothing which ought to be a trouble. Nothing
tangible and yet&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Mr. Sutgrove, do you&mdash;have
you ever experienced a presentiment of something
dreadful happening? No; that is not exactly what I mean.
I don't know how to explain myself without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she paused, and I discreetly kept silence. Presently
she resumed.</p>

<p>"Men are so stupid, or I would tell you all about it.
You would never understand."</p>

<p>I saw my opening and made use of it. "We men
may be stupid both individually and collectively," I said.
"But I can answer for one man being sympathetic to
anything you like to say to him."</p>

<p>She laughed. "I am so afraid you will think me silly."</p>

<p>"Miss Maitland&mdash;Evie&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Hush!" She stopped me with an adorable smile.
"You know you haven't caught the Motor Pirate, yet."</p>

<p>I summoned up the most injured expression permitted
by my contentment with my surroundings and
fell silent again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor boy!" she said mockingly. "It is unkind of
me to remind you of your vow, when you have already
done your best to fulfil it."</p>

<p>"Not quite my best, yet," I muttered sullenly.</p>

<p>"Anyhow I think you have done quite enough to
warrant my taking you into my confidence."</p>

<p>She said this quite seriously, and glancing up at her, I
saw she was looking into a glade of the wood with a preoccupied
expression on her pretty face, which showed me
that it was in reality no petty trouble which worried her.</p>

<p>"This scene is so delightfully restful. I love the
cool green lights and the cool grey shadows of the
woodlands in early summer," she remarked absently.</p>

<p>I had no eyes for aught but the face of the speaker,
though I was indirectly conscious that there was a good
deal of beauty in the wood. To me it seemed an
appropriate background, that was all.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "But about this presentiment of
yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is hardly a presentiment; in fact, I don't know
what to call it," she replied. Then she turned and faced
me. "Now listen. There's an acquaintance of mine,
whom I know very well and used to like a great deal.
Yes, I think I am right in saying used to like. Well,
for some undefined reason, my liking has change to something
very like fear."</p>

<p>"For what reason?" I asked.</p>

<p>"None," she replied. "Absolutely there is no reason
whatever."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"A case of Dr. Fell," I said. "Well, avoid your
Dr. Fell."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I am unable to do," she
answered, and I could see she was speaking truly.
"This fear has grown up in some degree, I think, from
a subtle sort of consciousness that the person in question
has it in his power to exert a curious influence over me.
I seem to be drawn against my will into an attitude
towards him which is not only against my judgment,
but also against my inclination."</p>

<p>"Him?" I asked. "Him? Is it Mannering?"</p>

<p>"Why, what made you think of him? Does he
affect you in the same way?" she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Far from it," I replied. My first feeling was one
of delight at discovering that my rival was more feared
than loved. But as I thought over the matter, my
astonishment grew. I had looked upon Mannering as
a rival, and as a favoured rival, but I was not prepared
to hear that Evie Maitland was afraid of him, or of
any other man for the matter of that, and I said so.</p>

<p>"A month ago, I should have laughed at the idea
myself," she replied, "but to-day&mdash;&mdash;" She shuddered
slightly. "Now you know why I feel so gay this morning.
The fact is, when on awakening this morning
I realized that I should be absolutely free from his
presence for two whole days, I hardly knew how to
contain myself for joy."</p>

<p>"Surely you must have some grounds for fearing
him, something in his manner&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. Yet I have thought&mdash;but it is nothing. When
we have been alone together he has sat once or twice
staring at me. I try to speak to him, but he sits and
stares and stares, with his eyes so bright and all the
time so sombre&mdash;so penetrating that I feel that he sees
quite through me. Just like one does in those unpleasant
dreams where one's clothes have somehow disappeared.
To-day, and now, it seems very silly, yet I
am certain I shall feel exactly the same the next time I
meet him. Then when he sees how confused I am he
gives a sort of a laugh, an unpleasant kind of a chuckle
without any merriment in it."</p>

<p>"He's a d&mdash;&mdash;d cad!" I cried hotly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," she answered. "I don't seem
to mind at the time. It is just as if I were in a dream,
for I am so fascinated in watching him that I have
no thoughts left for myself. It is when he has gone
that the thought seems unpleasant. Then I always
think I will never see him again, but the next time he
calls I feel bound to do so. There, now I have confided
in you, don't tell me I am a weak hysterical girl or
I really don't know what will happen to me."</p>

<p>She laid one of her little hands on my arm and
looked imploringly into my eyes.</p>

<p>"I know you are neither weak nor hysterical," I
replied.</p>

<p>"You will help me, won't you?" she asked.</p>

<p>I took both hands in mine and looked straight into
her eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"The only way I see of helping you," I said
deliberately, "is for you to give me the right to
do so."</p>

<p>She did not take her hands from my grasp.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Do you know, Jim," she said an hour later, when
we came out of the wood into the meadow, "that I told
you not to speak to me until you had captured the Motor
Pirate."</p>

<p>"You could not answer for me, darling," I replied.
"But I should not have done so if I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had not found the temptation to do so irresistible,"
she said, taking the words out of my mouth with so
bewitching an air, that again I found an irresistible
temptation confronting me.</p>

<p>We did not revert again to the curious influence
which Evie had declared Mannering exercised. She
would not allow of it. She wanted to think that he
had gone completely out of her life, and that no more
shadows were ever to fall across her path. And I was
too happy myself to wish to refer to anything which
should bring an unpleasant memory to her mind.</p>

<p>I shall never forget our walk home. The silver
thread of the Ver, the old monastery gate-house and the
ruins of Sopwell Priory in the foreground, the churches
of St. Stephens and St Michaels on either hand, and in
the centre of the picture the Abbey of St. Albans brooding
over all. We decided to be married in the abbey.
I trod on air.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>A CLOUD APPEARS ON LOVE'S HORIZON</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Mannering</span> remained absent for a week, and during
that time I learned from Evie a good deal about the
curious dread which he had inspired in her mind. Had
inspired, I say, for she assured me it had passed away,
and that she felt quite safe now she was promised
to be my wife. Our betrothal had been announced the
day after the never-to-be-forgotten walk to Bricket wood,
and I had hastened to make it known as widely as I
could, for I could think of no likelier method of ensuring
her against any further annoyance on the part of
Mannering. When he saw that he had lost, I could
not think that he would do otherwise than retire gracefully
from the scene. If, however, he failed to take
his failure kindly, I should not have the slightest hesitation
about sending him about his business. I should have
been tempted to do so without further delay, if there
had in reality been anything in Mannering's conduct to
which open exception could have been taken. Evie recognized
there was nothing of the sort as strongly as
myself, and she was even averse to do as I suggested,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and ask her father to hint to him that he should, for a
while at least, cease his visits to the house.</div>

<p>"You see," she remarked, "if he had made himself
offensive in any other way, I should have welcomed the
opportunity of speaking to papa about it. But he has
not. His attitude has been outwardly perfectly courteous,
and papa would only laugh at me if I were to tell him
what I have told you. He would not believe me if I
told him I was afraid of Mr. Mannering."</p>

<p>"Besides, you are now no longer afraid?" I said.</p>

<p>"No; I am no longer afraid of him. I am quite
sure of that," she repeated.</p>

<p>The manner in which she made the assertion ought
to have warned me that she was not quite so certain
on the point as she was willing to believe, but no such
thought crossed my mind at the time.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," I continued, "if when you see Mannering
again, you feel any recurrence of your dread, it will
be easy for me to pick a quarrel with him, and so compel
him to absent himself from the house. You see, he will
be unable to come here without meeting me."</p>

<p>Evie pouted a dissent. "You must not do that," she
remarked. "A quarrel with him would make both of
us look ridiculous. Everybody would conclude that you
were jealous; and I&mdash;I should not like to imagine any
one thinking that I gave you cause."</p>

<p>"My own darling!" I cried.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When once more we resumed our conversation, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
bethought me of another plan, and I suggested to Evie that
she could always find a retreat at my home in Norfolk,
if she wanted to get away from Mannering's presence.
My aunt, I knew, would be delighted to entertain her.
She agreed at once to adopt this course if the occasion
should arise. Thus I thought I had provided against
every contingency for the short period which was to
elapse before our wedding-day.</p>

<p>When Mannering did return, however, it seemed
as if we had been making preparations to meet a contingency
which was never likely to arise. He learned
of Evie's engagement from the Colonel, the morning after
his return to St. Albans. He took the news very well.
Much more coolly than I should have done had I been
the disappointed one. In fact, a few minutes after he had
been made acquainted with Evie's engagement, he came
to us where we were in the garden, and congratulated
us forthwith.</p>

<p>"You are a lucky fellow, Sutgrove," he said. "I
had cherished a faint hope that your luck might be mine,
and now the only consolation I have is that the best man
always wins."</p>

<p>Spoken in a different tone than that which he
employed, his words would have made a very pretty
compliment, but from his lips the words seemed to
be very like a sarcasm. However, I could pardon
the expression of a little bitterness under the circumstances,
so I made no reply; and, turning to Evie,
he continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I trust your new tie will not put an end to the
old friendships, Miss Maitland?"</p>

<p>"Why should it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They often do," he replied.</p>

<p>"Not if the old friendships are the real thing," I
interjected.</p>

<p>"No; not if they are the real thing," he repeated
slowly. "I hope you will find mine to be the real
thing."</p>

<p>A faint smile fluttered across his face as he spoke,
and was gone in an instant. Neither Evie nor myself
knew what to reply, and an awkward pause ensued. He
seemed to feel the awkwardness of it just as much as
either of us, and he changed the subject with an inquiry
as to whether anything further had been heard or seen
of the Motor Pirate during his own absence in Paris.</p>

<p>"I have been far too busy to even look at the papers,"
he explained, "and he might have been captured for all
I know."</p>

<p>"No such luck," I replied. "This time he seems
to have disappeared for good."</p>

<p>"I see I shall have to take up your job, and devote
my energies to the task of his capture," he said laughingly.
And, turning to Evie, he said, "I presume you
will not allow Sutgrove to take any risks of that sort now,
Miss Maitland?"</p>

<p>Again there was something sarcastic in his tone, and
I could see by the flush in Evie's cheek that the question
had angered her. She answered almost hotly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am quite sure if any one can capture the Pirate,
Jim can."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of giving up the pursuit just
at present," I added quietly, with a glance of thanks to
my dear one for her ready championship.</p>

<p>"I don't think I should trouble myself about any
Motor Pirate if I were in your position," he replied.
"I fancy if I were engaged to be married to the best
girl in the world, the first thing I should do would be
to eliminate every risk from my life, instead of looking
about for fresh ones. Besides, it seems scarcely fair on
the girl, does it?"</p>

<p>"Surely that depends on what the girl thinks, doesn't
it?" asked Evie. "A good many girls haven't much
admiration for the man who would act as you suggest."</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" returned Mannering. "I see now
where Sutgrove has succeeded. The prize always goes
to the adventurous."</p>

<p>Again there was a subtle provocation in his tone&mdash;something
very like a sneer. An angry retort was on
the tip of my tongue, but a glance from Evie checked
it, and soon after he left us together.</p>

<p>"You must not be angry with him," she said, as
soon as we were alone. "He does not know you as
I do; and besides I think he&mdash;he must be disappointed."</p>

<p>"There's not the slightest doubt about that," I
answered emphatically. "He is badly hit, and he takes
it pretty well considering. I know I shouldn't have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>taken my gruel so coolly. In fact, that is just what
I don't like about him. One never knows what is going
on behind that handsome mask of his."</p>

<p>"Handsome," she said. "Do you call him handsome?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I should say he was one of the handsomest
men of my acquaintance. How could you ever bestow
a single glance or thought upon me when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Evie placed her hand upon my lips. "You dear,
foolish old boy," she said. "There is only one face in
the whole wide world which I think is really handsome,
and I have thought so from the first time I caught sight
of it."</p>

<p>There was another interlude in our conversation&mdash;they
were pretty frequent in those days&mdash;and the subject
dropped for a time. It recurred frequently, however,
and gradually I perceived that whatever subject we discussed,
sooner or later, Mannering's name was bound to
crop up. At first I rather encouraged Evie to talk about
him; but, after a while, I discovered that I was ministering
to the feeling which I thought had been destroyed.
I could not help but notice that, soon after Mannering's
return, Evie's high spirits became subdued&mdash;her gaiety
less spontaneous. Yet when I asked her whether Mannering's
presence produced any effect upon her, she
assured me to the contrary.</p>

<p>Nor did I see how Mannering could possibly exert
any influence over her. I took particular care that he
should never have a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with her. Sometimes she
would not even see him for a couple of days at a time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and when she did, it would be merely for a few minutes,
and nearly always in the presence of Colonel Maitland
as well as myself.</p>

<p>It appeared to me, indeed, as if Mannering even took
pains to avoid seeing much of her; and, though I watched
him closely, his bearing was always studiously correct.
He was the same <i>insouciant</i> person who had impressed
me so favourably upon my first introduction to him.
But whether it was owing to the distrust which Evie's
fear of him had impressed upon me, or because I could
really see things which had before been hidden from
my sight, I certainly did observe about him certain singularities
which I had never before remarked. I saw, for
instance, that, in speaking of his face as a handsome
mask, I had been nearer the truth than I had known.
On more than one occasion, while his lips were parted
in a genial smile, I observed in his eyes an expression
strangely at variance therewith. It was the expression
of a cat when it crouches to spring upon a mouse. I
have seen that look bent upon my betrothed. I have
caught it directed at myself. There was a restlessness,
too, which gave the lie to his nonchalant manner. I
could see that he forced himself to remain still. His
fingers were always busy with something or other.</p>

<p>These were trifles, and equally trivial seemed the
sarcasms which he directed at me now and again.
These I attributed to the ebullitions of temper, natural
enough in a defeated suitor. In my heart I pitied
him, for I fancied I knew what a struggle it must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
cost him to stand aside and watch a successful rival's
happiness.</p>

<p>As the days passed, a certain constraint appeared to
have arisen between Evie and myself. I told myself that
the idea was foolish, and yet I knew that it was not
so. Mind, I had not the slightest doubt as to the
strength of Evie's love for me. She expressed it clearly,
yet there was something drawing us apart, and I began
to be afraid.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of June the tension became so
great, that I could see the time had arrived when it would
be necessary to do something; and, one night, I determined
to mention the matter. Accordingly, after dinner,
I persuaded Evie to come into the garden, with the intention
to speak firmly in my mind. There, however,
in the faint light of the summer night, with the sweet
scent of the early roses filling the air, I forgot everything
in the blissfulness of my lot. We had paced our favourite
walk once in silence&mdash;my heart was too full of delight for
speech&mdash;when, as we retraced our steps, to my surprise,
Evie burst suddenly into passionate tears. Some minutes
elapsed before I could calm her, and when I managed at
last to do so, it needed all my powers of persuasion to
get her to confide in me the cause of her outburst. At
first she said it was nothing but the hysteria of happiness.
Then she asked me, with a fierce clutch on my
arm, if I should think her unmaidenly if she asked that
our wedding-day should be hastened. We had fixed it
for September, so I at once suggested July.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mood changed at once. She said she was not
feeling well, and that I must not listen to her. But
being now thoroughly alarmed at her obviously nervous
condition, I questioned her until I elicited from her that
all her old dread of Mannering had returned, and with
double intensity, in that it was accompanied by a presentiment
of disaster to myself.</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, looking up into my face with eyes
which glowed in the faint light like stars, "I shall not
feel sure of you until I am with you always. I want to
be near you to look after you. Every moment you are
absent from my side, I am imagining all sorts of horrible
things happening to you. And it is worse to bear,
because, it seems to me, that I am the cause of
it all."</p>

<p>I strove to laugh away her fears, but, say what I
would, I could not dispel the thought in her mind that
some disaster threatened our love. Probing her mind
for the foundation of her belief, I was not surprised to
find that Mannering had something to do with it.</p>

<p>I did my best to make her mind easy, while determining
that I would at once take steps to secure change
of air and scene for her at some spot where my late rival
should not come. She became tolerably composed at last,
and I took her back to the drawing-room, where I was
glad to find Mrs. Winter, in whom I recognized a most
useful sedative for over-excited nerves.</p>

<p>We had a little music, and with that and the commonplaces
of conversation, the evening passed until eleven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had struck, and the Colonel's yawns warned me that the
time had arrived for taking my departure.</p>

<p>The Winters and myself had just risen to leave when
we heard a hasty step on the gravel outside, and, turning,
we saw a man's figure at one of the French windows
opening on to the garden.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the Colonel. "Who's that?"</p>

<p>The new-comer stepped into the room, and, as the
light fell upon his face, I recognized Forrest. He nodded
to me and turned to the Colonel.</p>

<p>"I trust you will excuse this unceremonious call of
mine, Colonel Maitland," he said. "But I was desirous
of seeing Mr. Sutgrove immediately, and I guessed I
should find him here."</p>

<p>"I'll excuse you, if you will come to the smoking-room
and drink Mr. Sutgrove's health in a whisky-and-seltzer,"
replied the Colonel, heartily.</p>

<p>"I don't think I can spare the time," said the
detective, quietly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man! You must drink the health of
my future son-in-law!" he declared.</p>

<p>"Most certainly," remarked Forrest. "I can find
time for that, even though&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, and then
said, with quiet incisiveness, "Even though the Motor
Pirate is upon the road again!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A CLUE AT LAST</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Immediately</span> Forrest had made his dramatic announcement,
I glanced at Evie, for in view of the apprehension
she had exhibited earlier in the evening, I was just a
little doubtful as to whether she would take kindly to
the renewal of my attempts to catch the Pirate. To
my satisfaction, she exhibited no signs of trepidation, if
she did not appear altogether delighted that I was to
have another opportunity of distinguishing myself. In
fact as soon as the detective had followed Colonel
Maitland from the room, she told me that she was
glad.</div>

<p>"I don't fear for you a scrap, Jim. At least not
much," she said. "I know you won't do anything
foolish, for my sake."</p>

<p>I interrupted with, "Nor for my own."</p>

<p>"And do you know," she continued, "I have a queer
sort of impression that when the Pirate is captured, this
horrible depression which has been hanging over me will
disappear altogether."</p>

<p>"Then captured he must be without delay," I said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Though I don't see how Mannering will be affected
thereby."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure about that," said Evie.</p>

<p>"You surely cannot think that Mannering is in any
way connected with the Motor Pirate?" I inquired in
surprise, for any such idea had long passed from my
mind.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she remarked dreamily; "I don't
know. But I should not be surprised. I really could
believe anything about him."</p>

<p>I reminded her of the steps Forrest had taken to
assure himself that there were no grounds for such a
suspicion, but she was not convinced; so I forbore to
continue the discussion, changing the conversation to
the arrangements to be made for her proposed visit to
Norfolk. It was decided that I should write at once
to my aunt, and that she should be ready to start the
moment I received a reply. We had settled all the
preliminaries by the time the Colonel and Forrest
returned, and I bade her good night, feeling quite easy
in my mind.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to be able to congratulate you," said
Forrest, the moment we were outside.</p>

<p>"I am the luckiest man in the world," I replied.</p>

<p>"You are," returned the detective, emphatically. "All
the same, I should not have been sorry if Miss Maitland
had stuck to her intention of refusing to listen to you
until after the capture of the Pirate."</p>

<p>"Why?" I demanded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"For purely selfish reasons," he replied. "I take it
you will not be so keen on the chase. Men in your
position don't take risks."</p>

<p>I held out my hand to him. "Put your fist in
that," I said. "What I have promised, I stick to; and,
to tell the truth, I was never keener on anything in
my life."</p>

<p>"That's good news for me," he answered, and I
could tell from his tone that he meant it. Besides, he
was not a man given to the paying of idle compliments.</p>

<p>We were walking quietly towards my cottage as we
talked, and the impulse came upon me to confide to him
the presentiment which Evie had in regard to the capture
of the Pirate relieving her from her burden of fear. That
necessitated my explaining as well as I could the curious
influence which Mannering exercised over her. Forrest
listened attentively.</p>

<p>"Curious," he muttered, when I had finished. "It
is very curious that the fellow should have produced such
an impression on Miss Maitland. By the way, he was
not at the Colonel's to-night."</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;&mdash;" he began. He never finished the
sentence, nor did he speak again until he reached my
door. There he paused, and said lightly, "I think I
should like to discover whether the disappointed lover is
at home to-night. Are you prepared for a little amateur
burglary, Sutgrove?"</p>

<p>"Ready for anything," I assured him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems a little absurd to suspect Mannering," he
remarked meditatively. "Yet there are times when a
woman's intuition is a better guide than a man's ratiocination."</p>

<p>"You didn't get any clue in Amsterdam, then?" I
asked tentatively, for I was curious to hear the results
of his journey.</p>

<p>"No, no. Nothing at all in Holland."</p>

<p>"If Mannering were the Pirate, and had tried to
dispose of his plunder there, you would in all probability
have caught him; but he would scarcely have chosen to
go abroad at the same time as yourself," I remarked.</p>

<p>Forrest emitted a long, low whistle. "By Jove!"
he said. "Then it was indeed he whom I saw in
Vienna."</p>

<p>"In Vienna?" I queried.</p>

<p>"When did he leave England?" asked the detective,
ignoring my question.</p>

<p>"The very day you left," I replied promptly.</p>

<p>"Come, this is getting interesting," he said. "Tonight
we will most certainly let the Pirate do his worst
on the roads. We will look for a clue to the mystery
of his identity nearer home." He looked at his watch.
"It's a little too early to pay our call, so if you don't
mind, I will come in and we can discuss the matter at
leisure."</p>

<p>To say that Forrest's enigmatic utterances filled me
with excitement, very inadequately expresses the state
of my mind. He followed me indoors, and, while I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
mixed a drink for each of us, he saw that the windows
and doors were closed. Then seating himself in an
easy chair, he selected a cigar and remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now we can talk."</p>

<p>"I thought you only intended to go to Amsterdam,"
I began.</p>

<p>"That was my intention," he replied. "But before
giving you the results of my inquiries&mdash;it won't take
long, by the way&mdash;I should like to ask you one or two
questions, if I may?"</p>

<p>"Fire away," I said.</p>

<p>"Did you mention to any one where I had gone?"</p>

<p>"Not to a soul. At least certainly not at the time,
though I have probably mentioned the matter to Miss
Maitland since."</p>

<p>"Oh, you young lovers!" he interjected.</p>

<p>"She would not speak of the matter, I know. I
gave out to every one else that you had been recalled
to London."</p>

<p>"Anyway, it would not have mattered if she had, as
Mannering left on the same day as myself. Where did
he say he was going?"</p>

<p>"He said he was bound for Paris on business connected
with some patents he was applying for. He told
us he would be absent for two or three days; and as a
matter of fact, he was away for ten."</p>

<p>"That would about fit in," remarked the detective,
after a moment's thought. "But of that you shall judge
for yourself." He moistened his lips and pulled at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
cigar until it was well alight, and then he commenced
his story.</p>

<p>"I carried out my original intention, and the night
after I left you I caught the 8.30 at Liverpool Street.
The next morning I was in Amsterdam. I stayed there
three days, until I was quite convinced that no such
parcel of diamonds as had been stolen had been offered
for sale to any of the Dutch dealers. I could not have
failed to hear of it if any such attempt had been made.
While there I had the good fortune to make the
acquaintance of a Russian agent, whose work I fancy
must have been largely political. Ivan Stroviloff his
name was, and he had acquaintances in most European
capitals. I discussed the matter with him. He thought
that an attempt to dispose of the stones was much more
likely to be made in Vienna or St. Petersburg than
anywhere else except Paris. I was aware of our agents
in Paris having been fully informed, and I knew it was
not worth my while to go there; but beyond notifying
the Austrian police, I doubted whether any steps had
been taken in regard to Vienna, so I determined to
proceed to the Austrian capital. Stroviloff proved a
very decent fellow, rather an exception to the general
run, for I don't take to those Russian agents as a rule;
and as I was able to give him a few hints and some
introductions over here&mdash;he was going on to London&mdash;he
gave me in return letters to some of his colleagues in
Vienna and Petersburg, thinking they would probably
be of more use to me than application through the usual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
official channels. Well, I went on to Vienna. I won't
weary you with a history of my fruitless inquiries, it
would take far too much time. Anyhow, I did find
eventually that a parcel of diamonds had been disposed
of there, and, as Stroviloff had predicted, I obtained the
information through one of the Russian agents and not
through the Viennese police. I will say that I do not
see how the latter could have helped me, for the purchaser
was the representative of a Petersburg house who
happened to be in Vienna for the purpose of attending
the sale of the Princess Novikoff's jewels&mdash;you probably
saw all about it in the papers."</p>

<p>It was a remarkable sale, and the extraordinary prices
realized are probably fresh in most people's memories.
I told Forrest I had seen accounts of it, and he
continued.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I did not get the information until
after the representative in question had returned to
Petersburg. There was nothing left for me to do but
to follow him there if I wanted to satisfy myself as to
whether the stones of which I had heard were really the
ones stolen from the mail. It was rather like a wild
goose chase, but I went. It was the day before I started
that I saw the man who reminded me so forcibly of your
friend Mannering. It was a very fleeting glimpse of a
face which looked in at the door of a restaurant where
I happened to be dining, and I should not like to swear
that it was he whom I saw. At the time, I put my
fancy down to one of those casual likenesses which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
sometimes lead even keen observers to accost total
strangers in the streets as acquaintances. The likeness
was, however, undeniable, in spite of something strange
about his appearance. However, I paid no attention to
the incident, and the next morning I was on my way to
Petersburg. There I found no difficulty in obtaining
full particulars from the dealer. I have no doubt but
that he has purchased the stones which were stolen from
the Brighton mail. In size, weight, and quality they
answered to the description perfectly. I learned from
him that the man from whom he had bought the stones
had been introduced to him by a well-known Viennese
jeweller. The price asked, though not very greatly
below market value, was low enough to tempt him to
purchase. The man who offered them suggested that
payment should be made, not to himself, but to his firm
in Amsterdam. The transaction seemed in every way
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i>, the explanation as to the low price being that
the Amsterdam firm was rather pressed for cash, and so
compelled to realize some of its stock, but was unable to
do so in Amsterdam for fear of jeopardizing its credit.
The man who sold the stones gave the name of Josef
Hoffman, and the merchant produced his card which
bore the name of Jacob Meyer and Meyer, and an
address in the De Jordaan, Amsterdam. He was
described to me as a tall, powerful, fresh-coloured, fair-haired
German, of pleasant manners and address. The
Petersburg merchant's representative had given him a
draft on an Amsterdam bank and, on reaching the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Russian capital, after examining the stones, his employer
had authorized the payment of the draft by telegraph.</p>

<p>"As soon as I obtained these particulars, I started
once more for the Dutch city without wasting much
time. Needless to say, I was too late to catch my man.
The office in the De Jordaan I found to be a room
which had been taken for a week or two, and then
vacated, by a person whom I easily identified as the
fair-haired German. The draft had been exchanged
for a draft on the banker's London agents by the same
man. I came on to London immediately, but Hoffman,
or whatever his name may be, was a week ahead of me.
I traced him to the London bank where he had cashed
his draft. He did it in the coolest manner imaginable.
He left it one day saying that he required gold, and that
if they would get the amount ready&mdash;it was over &pound;4000&mdash;he
would call for it the next day. He actually allowed
two days to elapse before doing so. Then he came in
a cab with a handbag and took away the gold. That
at present is as far as I have got. I only learned the
last of these particulars this afternoon, and of course I
went at once to the Yard to make my report and to
arrange for the circulation of the description of the
fair-haired German throughout the country. Then I
came on to you."</p>

<p>Forrest finished his drink and stood up. "Now you
know as much about the case as I do," he remarked,
"and I fancy it is about time for us to pay our proposed
visit to our friend Mannering."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see how you can connect him in any way
with Hoffman," I said, as I rose from my seat.</p>

<p>Forrest smiled. "I omitted to tell you one thing,"
he observed. "I could not see the hair of the man in
Vienna whose face seemed familiar to me. But one
thing I did remark. The man with Mannering's face
wore a fair moustache."</p>

<p>"But Mannering's is dark," I argued. "It was dark
when he went away and dark when he returned."</p>

<p>Forrest held up his hand mockingly. "In these
days of scientific progress nothing is easier than for the
intelligent leopard to change his spots. Ask the brunette
when fashion decrees that fair hair is to be worn, and
ask again of the blonde how she manages when the
exigencies demand raven tresses."</p>

<p>That settled me. "There's only one thing more,"
I said. "When did you hear that the Motor Pirate
was at work again?"</p>

<p>"At St. Albans. I called at the police office on my
way here. He was seen about ten o'clock this side of
Peterborough and going north."</p>

<p>"It will be rather a sell if Mannering is at home," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"He will not be at home," replied Forrest with
conviction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>I COMMIT A BURGLARY</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> night was moonless, but there was that soft diffused
light in the air invariable in June, except on the cloudiest
of evenings. There was just enough of it to enable us to
see our way as we strolled towards Mannering's house.
When we reached it everything appeared still. All the
windows were dark. I felt my heart beginning to beat
faster than ordinarily as Forrest lifted the latch of the
gate opening on to the strip of garden, which lay between
the road and the house. We walked along the turf
edging of the path in order that our feet might not crunch
upon the gravel. Forrest was first. He went straight to
the front door and tried it. It was fast.</div>

<p>"We will try one of those French windows," he
whispered after returning to my side.</p>

<p>The house was a two-story cottage with a verandah
opening on the south side facing a lawn. On to this
verandah windows opened from both the dining and
sitting-rooms, the servants' quarters being on the other
side of the house.</p>

<p>We went round the angle of the building and tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the first window. It was fastened. With cat-like tread
Forrest glided on to the second. It was one of the two
giving entrance to the sitting-room. A sibilant sound
from the detective's lips took me to his side. Without
hesitating a second, he threw back the casement and
stepped into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Come," he muttered, and I followed.</p>

<p>Heavy curtains veiled the windows and past these the
darkness was thick enough to be felt. Of a sudden there
was a crack which made me start. It was only Forrest
striking a match. With imperturbable confidence, he
stepped towards a table and lit the lamp which stood
thereon. I felt exceedingly uncomfortable, but Forrest
obviously knew no such qualms, for he at once proceeded
to examine every object in the room. So far as I could see,
there was nothing at all unusual about the place. The
room was in exactly the same condition as I had observed
it hundreds of times before when I had dropped in for a
smoke and a chat. On the table, beside the lamp, was a
tantalus and a glass, and a half empty syphon. The glass
had been used and the ash on the floor, beside an armchair,
showed that a cigar had accompanied the drink. A pair
of slippers lay on the hearth rug as if they had been carelessly
kicked off. Forrest pointed to them.</p>

<p>"Mannering is not at home," he said. "If he had gone
to bed, these would not be here."</p>

<p>"I hope he will not return while we are about," I
muttered.</p>

<p>"It would be a little awkward for him," said Forrest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>,
calmly. "I should be compelled to arrest him in self-defence,
and I am not prepared to do so at present."</p>

<p>He did not, however, hurry his movements in any way
as he proceeded to deliberately search the room. Only
once did he pause, and that was when he discovered a continental
time-table of recent date. He brought the book
to the light and turned over the pages carefully. A gleam
of exultation crossed his face, as he pointed out to me a
trace of tobacco ash between the pages which gave details
of the train service between Vienna and Amsterdam.</p>

<p>"We are on the right track," he observed.</p>

<p>But that one slight piece of evidence was all that the
most careful examination of the room revealed, although
there was not a drawer nor a shelf which he did not overhaul.</p>

<p>"We must try his bedroom," he remarked, when he
had finished with the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"What about the servants?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If they are not asleep, they will merely imagine that
it is their master going to bed," he replied, as taking a
candlestick, which stood on an occasional table near the
door, he passed out of the room. I followed him upstairs,
with my heart in my mouth, and pointed out to him the
door of the room which Mannering occupied. As Forrest
turned the handle and entered, I was quite prepared to
make a bolt for it. I should not have been a bit surprised
to have discovered our suspect sleeping quietly within.
But Forrest turned and beckoned me to enter. The room
was empty, and this time I assisted the detective in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
search. Between us we subjected the bedroom and the
adjoining dressing-room to the closest scrutiny, but without
result. We could not, unfortunately, make an exhaustive
examination, for there were one or two ancient
presses which were locked, and the Chubb safe let into
the wall by the bed head was likewise fastened.</p>

<p>The detective shrugged his shoulders when we had
done.</p>

<p>"As we haven't a burglar's outfit, we shall have to
wait until we have a search warrant," he muttered.</p>

<p>With a disappointed air he led the way out of the
room. On the landing he paused. His keen gaze had rested
for a moment on a travelling bag which stood under a
table. There were the remains of a number of labels
upon it and he scanned them carefully. There was no
sufficient of any one of them left for identification.</p>

<p>"He's a clever devil," he whispered.</p>

<p>Then he opened the bag and again his countenance
lightened. Inside was an empty bottle bearing the label
of a London chemist, with the additional superscription&mdash;"Peroxide
of Hydrogen."</p>

<p>"The fair hair is accounted for," commented Forrest.
"And as for the dye which would restore his locks to their
natural colour, I presume he has it under lock and key."</p>

<p>He slipped the bottle into his pocket and returned
downstairs, I following at his heels.</p>

<p>"There's not enough at present against him to warrant
his arrest," he said, when we were again in the
sitting-room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why not have a look round his workshops," I
suggested.</p>

<p>"His what?" queried Forrest, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Haven't I ever mentioned them to you? Haven't
you ever heard that Mannering spends all his spare time in
experimental motor construction?" I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"I think I have heard it mentioned, but until this
moment I have always thought it was chaff," he replied.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" I ejaculated.</p>

<p>"I should have been inside that shop a couple of
months ago," he continued, "if I had thought&mdash;&mdash; Whereabouts
is the shop?"</p>

<p>"Just at the back of the house and abutting on the
side of the road," I explained. "The old coach-house and
stables." Then as the thought occurred to me, I continued,
"Why I heard him tell you of his work himself."</p>

<p>"That's precisely the reason why I paid no attention
to it," said my companion. "Can you take me to the
place?"</p>

<p>I led the way through the French window, Forrest
putting out the light before he followed me, and carefully
closing the casement behind him as he stepped on to the
verandah. A clock, somewhere in St. Albans, struck the
half after two as we crossed the lawn in the direction of
the workshop.</p>

<p>"We have only a short time at our disposal,"
whispered Forrest. "The darkness is lifting, and our
friend will soon be returning."</p>

<p>We passed through a side door, which we found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
unlocked, into what had once been the stable-yard. But
we could get no further. The two doors which gave
admission to the building were firmly fastened, and there
was no available window by which we might gain
entrance. We retraced our steps, and, passing out of
the door, approached the stables from the road. By this
time the dawn had made such progress that we knew
our chances of getting inside before Mannering's return
were dwindling rapidly. We found no more likelihood
of obtaining admission from this side than the other.</p>

<p>"I cannot arrest a man on the evidence of a few
grains of tobacco dust, and an empty phial," declared
Forrest, savagely, as he shook the tightly locked door.
"Listen!" I said.</p>

<p>Borne on the wind came the throb of a motor. So
still was the air that when the sound first reached our
ears it must have been a mile away. The sound drew
nearer and nearer, and while it was still a quarter of a
mile distant, I recognized the familiar noise of Mannering's
car, a sound as dissimilar to the hum of the
Pirate car as it was possible to conceive.</p>

<p>"Forrest," I cried, turning to my companion, "we
must be mad to think that Mannering could play the
part of the Motor Pirate on that old car of his."</p>

<p>There was something so irresistibly ludicrous in the
idea, that we both indulged in a hearty fit of laughter,
and with one accord we turned and walked down the road.</p>

<p>"He may keep his fast car elsewhere," remarked the
detective, when his mirth had subsided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be difficult to bring the guilt home to him
if we failed to discover the car," I replied.</p>

<p>A few seconds later we met the man whom we had
so lately suspected. I felt a tinge of shame at the thought
that, a few minutes previously, I had been sneaking into
his house in the hope that I should find evidence to convict
him of a crime. By this time dawn was sufficiently
advanced to allow of recognition, and as he came level
with us Mannering pulled up.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Sutgrove!" he shouted. "You're about
betimes. Been on the same job as myself?"</p>

<p>"What's that, Mr. Mannering?" asked Forrest</p>

<p>"Looking for an opportunity to pay back this little
debt," was the light answer, as the speaker tapped his
shoulder gently.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" said Forrest, dryly.</p>

<p>"Not a scrap," was the ready reply. "You see I'm
a bit handicapped with this old car, for unless the fellow
happens to take the same road as myself, there's precious
little chance of my picking him up. Still, if you do not
soon succeed in catching him, I think I shall have a good
try myself."</p>

<p>"I suppose by that you know who he is," I remarked,
more in order to see what he would say than in the hope
of eliciting anything.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest idea on the subject," he responded
promptly. "I am merely hoping that in a few days I
shall be in possession of a new motor from which even
the Pirate will be unable to escape."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>I made a gesture of surprise.</p>

<p>"Fact," he continued. "My experiments have
proved successful at last. In a week I shall have delivered
to me the new motor I have designed, and then the Pirate
had better look out. Good night."</p>

<p>Waving an adieu, he set his car in motion, and jogged
along until he reached the door of his coach-house. We
watched him dismount, unlock the door, and disappear
inside.</p>

<p>"It beats me," remarked Forrest.</p>

<p>"Surely you do not still harbour any suspicion concerning
him?" I inquired in amazement.</p>

<p>Forrest made no reply. His head was bent, his
brow knitted deeply, his hands clasped behind him as we
turned and walked back to my place. He did not speak
until we stopped on my doorstep.</p>

<p>"I wish he had not seen us," my companion then
remarked. "He will be bound to tumble to the conclusion
that we suspect him, and will be on his guard."</p>

<p>"Then you do still suspect him," I cried again.</p>

<p>"If I had one scrap of direct evidence," replied the
detective, emphatically, "I would have him under arrest
within half an hour. Only one little scrap," he almost
groaned. "But, as it is, my reputation would not survive
if I made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Why, you don't imagine that he would go so far as
to shoot himself just to avert suspicion," I asked, still
incredulous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p><p>Forrest drew himself up smartly. "Good Lord!
What a fool I am! What&mdash;a&mdash;blind&mdash;dunderheaded&mdash;jackass!"
he cried.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" I inquired smiling, for
the detective was groping in his pockets. "Have you
lost anything?"</p>

<p>From his waistcoat pocket he produced a small leaden
bullet, and he held it outstretched in the palm of his
hand.</p>

<p>"Here have I been wasting weeks on the continent,
while with this I might have settled the matter once and
for all."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I needed but to compare this with the bullet the
surgeon extracted from Mannering's shoulder. This is
the one which killed the poor fellow near Towcester. If
Mannering's bullet is identical with this, I should have
nothing more to say; but," he continued meaningly, "both
your revolver and mine are of a different calibre to the
weapon which fired this. If the bullet which hit
Mannering should prove to fit either of our weapons,
there would be no need to seek for further evidence. I
must see that surgeon at once."</p>

<p>He started off rapidly down the garden path. I
hurried after him and laid my hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Steady, old man," I remarked. "You can hardly
knock up a hardworked medical man at 3.30 a.m. just
to ask him a question."</p>

<p>Forrest stopped and gave a short laugh. "Upon my
word, I had entirely forgotten what the time was. No,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
you are quite right. There is no need for such excessive
hurry. Mannering is safe enough for the present."</p>

<p>"At least, for the next eighteen hours," I observed,
after glancing at my watch. "Meanwhile, your room
has been kept ready for you."</p>

<p>"A little sleep will not come amiss," he answered,
yawning; "though it seems almost a pity to go to bed on
such a morning."</p>

<p>He was right. By this time dawn was breaking with
a splendour I have never seen equalled before nor since.
From east to west the sky was stained and flecked with
crimson and gold, and our faces glowed ruddily in the
reflected light. We both fell to silence, as with our
faces to the east we watched the uprising of the sun;
and, until the sky paled as the sun made its appearance
above the line of the horizon, we did not stir.</p>

<p>Then Forrest drew a deep breath. "There's been
the beauty of destruction in the sunrise," he remarked.
"We shall have a storm before nightfall."</p>

<p>He followed me indoors, and, leaving him at the door
of his room, I went to my own. I got into my pyjamas,
but I did not feel inclined to sleep for the sunbeams
were glancing in at my window, and all about were the
sound and movement of the awakening earth-creatures.
I wheeled an easy chair to the window, and wrapping a
blanket about me, took a novel I had been reading and
strove to fix my attention on the pages. I could not do
so. Whether it was the reflex action of the brain from
the excitement of the evening or not, but the fact was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
I felt unaccountably depressed. I fought against the
feeling as best I could. But I could not get out of my
head the idea that some great danger was threatening,
not myself, but the one dearest to me in the world.
From my window I could see her home, and I drew the
chair into a position where my eyes might rest upon the
roof which sheltered her. There was some consolation
in this, and I watched until I eventually fell into an
uneasy slumber, from which I awakened unrefreshed and
ill at ease.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>STORM</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My</span> tub pulled me together to some extent, but I still
felt restless when I went downstairs. Forrest had
already gone out, leaving word that he expected to be
back to breakfast at the usual hour. I went into the
garden, but the sun was shining in a cloudless sky and
there was not a breath of air stirring. It was insufferably
hot and I was glad to return into the shade of the
house.</div>

<p>The detective came in panting, a little later, with
disappointment plainly written in his face.</p>

<p>"The surgeon out?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "But he was not much use
though. Mannering kept the bullet. He wanted to
retain it, so he said, as a memento of his adventure."</p>

<p>"Perfectly natural," I commented.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," returned Forrest. "The unfortunate
result is, that his doing so prevents me from dismissing
the possibility of his being the Pirate from my mind.
And I ought to be doing something. Last night the
rascal seems to have been everywhere. Apparently he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
was actuated with a desire to destroy everything which
stood in his path. One would judge him to have become
absolutely reckless. Instead of avoiding the towns, he
courted observation by passing through them. This
morning at the police office, I heard particulars of at
least half a dozen cases of unoffending people being
ruthlessly ridden down, and Heaven only knows how
many more there may be of which the details are not
yet to hand. The sheer devilry of his progress is simply
amazing. What it comes to is this, Sutgrove. If I
can't get hold of him within the next week I may as
well resign the force at once. If I don't resign I shall
be dismissed, and quite deservedly."</p>

<p>I tried to say something consolatory, but he would
not hear me; and it was not until after he had made
a savage attack upon the eggs and rashers and had
swallowed three cups of tea, that his usual equanimity
returned.</p>

<p>"What's the next move?" I asked, when breakfast
was done.</p>

<p>"I am going to town to see if I can identify the
purchaser of this bottle," he replied, holding up the phial
he had taken from the bag in Mannering's house the
night before; "and to inquire whether anything more
has been heard of the fair-haired German."</p>

<p>"Then I can be of no assistance to you, to-day?" I
said.</p>

<p>"None whatever beyond remaining here and keeping
an eye upon our friend. I shall ask for another man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to-day to assist in shadowing him, but until his arrival
I should be glad for some one to keep me acquainted
with his movements. If, as I presume you will, you go
over to Colonel Maitland's, you cannot help seeing
whether he leaves his house."</p>

<p>I promised to do as he wished, and shortly after he
had gone, I took my hat and strolled over to the Colonel's
place.</p>

<p>Evie appeared to have quite recovered from her fears
of the previous evening, and being busily engaged upon
domestic duties, she sent me to join her father under the
shade of a big tree on the lawn. There solaced by an
iced lemon squash and the newspaper, I managed to
pass the morning very comfortably. Mannering gave
no sign of existence.</p>

<p>I took myself home for lunch, remembering letters
I had to write. I felt much easier in mind, and made
a hearty meal in consequence. The result was that I
fell asleep over my cigar afterwards.</p>

<p>I awoke suddenly, wondering where I was. Then I
thought I must have slept for hours, for a blackness only
one degree less than that of night brooded over the
earth. I took out my watch lazily, and was surprised to
see that the hands only pointed to five. I sat still for
a minute or two striving to collect my thoughts, for my
head was heavy. I held my watch to my ear. It had
not stopped. I jumped up and walked to the window,
and I saw at once the reason why I had imagined that
night had fallen. From east to west and from north to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
south a dense pall of cloud hung over the earth. Not
a leaf moved, and except for the shrill chirp of a grasshopper,
not a sound broke the uncanny stillness.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" I muttered, "we are going to have it
hot."</p>

<p>There came upon me an intense desire to be near
Evie during the progress of the storm which threatened
every moment to break. I did not wait to analyse the
feeling, but catching up my hat I bolted straight out of
the window. I had only a couple of hundred yards to
traverse, but when I reached the Colonel's house, so hot
and heavy was the air, that I was soaked from head to
foot in perspiration. I paused at the gate to wipe my
brow with my handkerchief, and at the moment the
storm broke. I heard the crackle of the lightning as it
slid from the sky, and the thunder clap followed so
swiftly that for a moment I felt deafened. I waited no
longer, but raced across the lawn and into the open
French window of the drawing-room. The apartment
was unoccupied, so I passed through into the hall. That
was vacant too, and I continued my search through the
morning-room to the Colonel's sanctum. There I saw
the genial warrior standing at the window, and watching
the play of the lightning with every appearance of interest.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Colonel!" I said. "Where's Evie?"</p>

<p>"Isn't she in the drawing-room? She was there
twenty minutes ago," he replied.</p>

<p>"She is not there now, I have just come through," I
explained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I fancy she will be in all probability in her
bedroom with her head under the sheets," he said,
chuckling.</p>

<p>"At all events I will send one of the maids to see,"
I said.</p>

<p>I rang the bell, and after giving a message to the maid
who answered the summons, I joined the Colonel at the
window. He appeared to be very pleased with the progress
the storm was making.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness this will clear the air," he explained,
as a reason for his satisfaction. "It was so hot
that I could take no lunch but a mayonnaise, iced
strawberries, and a glass of hock. Don't you think the
air is cooler already? I begin to feel quite an appetite
for dinner. My only fear is that, if the thunder has not
turned everything sour, it will have frightened my cook
out of her senses, and there will be nothing to appease
my appetite."</p>

<p>The window at which we were standing faced
towards Mannering's house. There was a stretch of
lawn outside and, beyond, a thicket of shrubs and small
trees between the grounds of the two residences. I was
glancing in the direction of these, when I thought I saw
something white moving in the shrubbery. I was about
to say something to the Colonel when a crash of thunder
drowned the utterance. At the next flash of lightning,
I perceived that my eyes had not deceived me, and in an
instant I jumped to the conclusion that it was Evie who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>was out there in the storm. Without a moment's
hesitation I vaulted through the window and raced across
the lawn. The Colonel must have thought me mad.</p>

<p>It was something of a shock for me to find that I
was right in my conjecture. There, huddled up under
the spreading branches of a cedar, stood my darling, her
eyes wide open, her cheeks blanched with terror.</p>

<p>"Why, Evie, dear heart! What is the matter?" I
cried.</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice she started, and, with a
little cry of delight, she threw herself into my arms.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come&mdash;I knew you would
come!" she sobbed hysterically.</p>

<p>The cedar under which she was standing was close
to the hedge, and I fancied, as she spoke, that I saw a
figure move away from the other side of the hedge. I
could not verify my suspicion, for Evie needed all my
attention. She had fainted. Catching her up, I bore
her across the lawn to the house.</p>

<p>It was some time before she came to herself, and
then, at her own request, I left her with her maid and
returned to the Colonel. Needless to say I was very
much worried in my mind. Why Evie should have been
sheltering in the shrubbery from the storm, with the
house so near, seemed unexplainable, and I awaited with
anxiety the time when I could learn the reason from her
own lips. The presence of the figure&mdash;the figure of a
man&mdash;on the opposite side of the hedge, was also inexplicable.
I should have guessed it to be Mannering, but
I would have staked my life upon Evie's truthfulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
when she had told me how much she had learned to
detest him. Besides, her delight was obvious when I
arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>Not until the evening, however, did I get a chance
of speaking to Evie again. The Colonel and I dined
alone, Evie sending word to say that the storm had left
her with a headache, and that she would join us later. I
was so silent during the meal that my host grew quite
merry at my expense.</p>

<p>"Wait till you are married, my boy," he remarked.
"There will come times when you will be grateful for
these feminine headaches."</p>

<p>I hate cheap witticisms of this sort, but I could hardly
resent them from the Colonel as I could have done had
they fallen from any one else's lips; but I fancy he saw at
last that they were distasteful to me, for after a while he
forebore to comment upon my dour looks.</p>

<p>About ten Evie came downstairs. By this time the
storm had passed away entirely, and the air was deliciously
fresh and cool after the rain. It was a strangely subdued
girl who came nervously to me, and shrank away from
me as I kissed her.</p>

<p>"No, Jim, no! You mustn't do that," she said.</p>

<p>Colonel Maitland had slipped away upon his daughter's
entrance, and we were alone.</p>

<p>"Why, darling, what ails you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing. Oh! don't ask me," she almost
wailed in reply.</p>

<p>I put my arm about her waist, and drew her down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
beside me to a seat on a big Chesterfield drawn before
one of the windows. She resisted faintly at first, but
presently I heard her give a sigh of content, and felt her
nestle towards me. Then I spoke.</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear, what possessed you to go out into
the storm?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she murmured&mdash;"I don't know.
I&mdash;I felt that I must. I didn't think it was going to
break so soon, and then the first flash of lightning
and the voice of the thunder! It was like judgment
day."</p>

<p>"It is all passed and over," I remarked, with a man's
clumsy attempt at consolation.</p>

<p>"I wish it were&mdash;I wish it were," she repeated, with
an indrawn sigh.</p>

<p>"It is all over hours ago," I said.</p>

<p>She broke away from me passionately. "Oh! Jim,
you don't know," she cried.</p>

<p>"I don't know what?" I inquired, as I attempted to
draw her to me again.</p>

<p>She pushed my hands away with a gesture of despair.
Then with an effort she rose to her feet, and looking at
me straight in the face, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jim, this must not go on. It is more than I can
bear."</p>

<p>I rose to my feet too, my heart beating wildly. "I
don't understand you," I answered, though I comprehended
her meaning only too well. "What must not
go on?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our&mdash;our engagement," she faltered. She was
white to the lips as she said the words.</p>

<p>I staggered back under the blow, then leaning forward
I sought to take her hand.</p>

<p>"No, Jim, no!" she said. "It's no use; I can never
be yours. It is impossible&mdash;quite impossible. My love
would be fatal to you! I know it will! He said so."</p>

<p>"He?" I asked.</p>

<p>She faltered. "Oh! I cannot help believing him.
He tells me that I am to be his." She shuddered. "Jim,
you must leave me, and never see me again. I cannot
have your&mdash;your blood on my hands."</p>

<p>She held out her slender white fingers, and I saw that
the ring which I had placed there had been removed.
Though my brain was awhirl, I tried my utmost to be
calm. I think the effort was successful, and that my
voice was fairly even when I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, darling, a promise is a promise, and my own
little girl is not going to break her promise because of the
threats of a jealous rival."</p>

<p>She shuddered from head to foot. "You don't know
him as I know him," she murmured. "He would stick
at nothing, Jim. I don't think he is a man; he must be
a devil. He can do things no man ever thought of
doing."</p>

<p>"You exaggerate his capacities for evil," I said, as
equably as I was able, for her agitation was so great that
I feared for her reason. "What has Mannering been
saying to you, for it was he whom I saw behind the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hedge when I brought you out of the storm, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"You saw him?" she queried. "Then it is true.
I have been hoping you would tell me I had been dreaming
again."</p>

<p>"I saw nothing very terrible about him," I remarked.</p>

<p>"You don't know him," she said again.</p>

<p>"He will have cause to know me before many hours
have passed," I declared savagely.</p>

<p>She clung to me in terror. "No, Jim. You must
not go near him. You do not know the power he
exercises. This afternoon I was sitting thinking of you
when I became conscious that he was telling me to come
to him. There was no reason why I should have thought
so. He was not in sight, but I was bound to go."</p>

<p>"And you found him waiting for you?" I asked
quietly, though my brain was aflame, for I was determined
to ascertain all that had passed between them.</p>

<p>"He was waiting for me," she repeated&mdash;"waiting
for me and the storm. That must have come at his
bidding too. It was horrible waiting for him to speak&mdash;horrible!
I tried to ask him what he wanted, but my
tongue was tied. Not until after the first peal of thunder
did he utter a word. Then he told me the time was
nearly at hand when he should come for me." I clenched
my fists involuntarily, but I did not interrupt my darling's
story. "I begged of him to leave me free. He paid no
heed. 'I am going away,' he said. 'For three days
you will see nothing of me, though all England will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
talking of my deeds. On the third I shall return. Mind
you are ready.'"</p>

<p>"Did you not mention me?" I remarked weakly. I
hardly knew what to say, for it seemed to me that either
Evie must be the victim of some extraordinary hallucination,
or else that Mannering was mad.</p>

<p>"He mentioned you," she replied. "'Tell Sutgrove,'
he said, 'that he has three days in which to capture the
Motor Pirate and make sure of his bride. After that he
will be too late. Tell him, too, that death waits on the
fool who fails.'"</p>

<p>"It's a sporting challenge," I muttered, for I had no
doubt now in my mind that Mannering and the Pirate
were identical.</p>

<p>My words did not reach Evie's ear, for she continued,</p>

<p>"Now you know why I have put away your ring.
He is too strong for us. I must do as he bids me.
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I interrupted her sharply. "Have you everything
packed to go away on your visit to Norfolk to-morrow?"
I asked.</p>

<p>The tone of my voice roused her. She looked at me
wildly.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;" she said. Then the expression
faded out of her face. For the second time that day she
had fainted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH THE PIRATE APPEARS IN A FROLICSOME
HUMOUR</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> fainting fit which terminated my conversation with
Evie alarmed me tremendously, and as soon as I could
summon assistance I sent for a doctor. She came round
before the medical man arrived, but I did not revert to
the topic which had agitated her. Indeed, she appeared
listless and disinclined to say a word on any subject.
Colonel Maitland was less worried than myself, but even
he was anxious until after the doctor had seen her and
assured him that his daughter was merely suffering from
over excitement, and that a sedative and a good night's
rest would probably restore her completely.</div>

<p>I was not so sure that such would be the case, and
when she had retired I thought it well to take the
Colonel into his study and give him as full an account as
I could of all that had led up to the fainting fit. He
listened to my story with attention, and when I had
done, though I could plainly see that he thought his
daughter's fears were due to her own morbid fancy, yet
he agreed with me that it would be well that she should
have a change of scene at the earliest possible moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>After arriving at this decision I determined to at once
seek out Mannering, and demand from him some explanation
of his conduct, for I could not conceive that
Evie's story was entirely the outcome of her imagination.
It was a delicate subject to discuss, yet I did not hesitate.
I was in no humour to mince matters. My anger,
though I had kept it well under control hitherto, only
needed the slightest fanning to bring it to a white heat,
and I longed whole-heartedly that Mannering would
afford me some excuse for giving physical expression to
my feelings.</p>

<p>I walked up to his front door, and knocked in a
manner to denote with sufficient distinctiveness that the
mood of the knocker was the imperative. I could see by
the lights within that the inmates of the house had not
retired to rest, but I had to repeat my summons before
there was any response. Then I heard footsteps within,
and the door opening an inch or two, a voice inquired
who was there.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Mannering in?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sutgrove, is it?" replied the voice, and upon
my answering in the affirmative, the door was thrown
open, and I saw the two maidservants standing in the
hall.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said the parlourmaid.
"We didn't expect any one at this time of night."</p>

<p>"That's all right," I answered. "Can I see Mr.
Mannering?"</p>

<p>"He's gone away for a day or two, sir," said the girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's very sudden, isn't it?" I asked. "I saw him
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He said nothing about it to us until after
dinner. Then he packed his handbag and went away on
his motor."</p>

<p>"It's a confounded nuisance," I remarked. "I wanted
to see him on important business. Did he say where he
was going?"</p>

<p>"He said Cromer, sir, but he did not leave any
address.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: this closing quotation marked added">"</ins> Then, after a momentary hesitation, she added,
"Is&mdash;is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>I looked at her keenly. She dropped her eyes, and
I could see there was something on her mind.</p>

<p>"What makes you ask?" I enquired.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," she replied, with obvious embarrassment.</p>

<p>"There must be something or you would not have
asked," I said encouragingly. "Come&mdash;out with it."</p>

<p>She still hesitated, but the housemaid was bolder.
"I'll tell the gentleman if you don't, Sarah," she declared.
"It's like this, sir," she rattled out volubly: "the master,
Mr. Mannering that is, has been so queer in his ways
lately that Sarah and me 'as been quite scared. Not that
he 'asn't been quite the gentleman. He always was that,
wasn't he, Sarah? But he's been that restless and bound
up in himself lately&mdash;walking up and down in his room
and talking to himself. He always was one to shut
himself up in that nasty old coach-house with his
experiments and things, but he was quiet, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
never took no account of it. But lately he's been
different."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, instead of going to bed like a Christian he's
up all hours of the night. It ain't only that. He slips
out as if he didn't want us to see him, and when we've
known he hasn't been at home we've found he's taken
the trouble to tumble the bed to make it appear as how
he slept in it."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" I remarked. "If that's all, my servants
would probably say the same about me. You need not
be alarmed about such trifles."</p>

<p>"But it's not all," said Sarah, taking up the story.
"The nights he goes out are just the nights the Pirate
makes his appearance."</p>

<p>"Those are just the nights I am away from home,"
I said.</p>

<p>"But you have the detective gentleman with you,"
argued the girl, "and when you come back I warrant
you do not bring diamond studs back with you that don't
belong to you."</p>

<p>"What!" I cried. "What!"</p>

<p>"It's truth, sir," said the housemaid. "A week ago,
just after he came back from Paris, I was sweeping the
floor of his bedroom, when I sweeps up a diamond stud.
Now, I knew he never had such a thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose you know exactly what jewellery he has?"
I interrupted, laughing.</p>

<p>"He always was a very careless gentleman until the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
last month, before which he left his things lying about
all over the place, but then he had a safe put in his
bedroom, and he never so much as left the key lying
about. However, I mentions the stud to Sarah, and we
talks it over and puts two and two together, and Sarah
thinks that if he doesn't ask what has become of it, it
might be as well as if we told the detective gentleman
about it."</p>

<p>"Quite right," I remarked. "You might let me
look at the stud, though."</p>

<p>After a little pressing the girls fetched the trinket, and
I perceived that it very closely resembled the stud Winter
had worn on the night of our first encounter with the
Pirate. I said nothing about this supposition to the
maids, but bidding them to be careful not to mention
the matter to any one until they had seen Forrest, whom
I promised should call upon them, I left the house.</p>

<p>Though disappointed in my original intention of
forcing an explanation from Mannering, I was by no
means ill pleased with the result of my visit to his house.
My suspicions as to his identity with the Pirate had
become considerably stronger, and once that identity was
established I fancied I should have little difficulty in
preventing any further annoyance at his hands.</p>

<p>Yet when I came to think calmly upon the subject I
could not fail to see how frail was the foundation upon
which my suspicions were built up. The fancies of a
girl, the suspicions of a couple of gossiping servants,
and the discovery of a stud, which might or might not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
prove to be the one which had been stolen from Winter.
I longed for Forrest to return, for I felt utterly incapable
of resting, and as he had not put in an appearance by
midnight, I got out my car and went into St. Albans to
meet him. At the police station there was no news of
him to be obtained, but I did learn that the Pirate had
been seen, his presence having been reported from the
vicinity of Bedford.</p>

<p>Knowing that it would be impossible for me to sleep
until I had seen Forrest; knowing, too, how unlikely it
was that he would now return to St. Albans before morning,
I thought I might at least have one shot on my own
account of bringing off the capture I so ardently desired.
So, in case of an untoward accident happening, I scribbled
a note to the detective, telling him briefly what I had
heard from the servants, and my intentions; and making
sure that my revolver was in working order, I bade my
friends at the police-station good night, and departed.</p>

<p>I knew it would be useless to take the direct road to
Bedford if I wished to meet the Pirate, and, as he had
been reported going east, I took the route through Hertford,
trusting that I might be able to cut him off upon
his return. I gleaned nothing concerning him at either
Hertford or Ware, and was so doubtful of proceeding
further in that direction that I left it to the arbitrament
of a coin to determine whether I should go on by a road
with which I was unacquainted to Cambridge through
Bishop's Stortford, or take a route I knew through Royston.
The choice fell upon the Stortford road, and later I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
glad I had taken it, for about a mile to the south of Stortford
I discovered that I was upon the right track.</p>

<p>I was bowling along at about fifteen miles an hour
when I came upon two horses grazing at the road-side.
They galloped off at my approach, and, a few seconds
later, I came upon a specimen of the Pirate's handiwork,
which at first sight was irresistibly ludicrous. A brougham
was drawn up at the side of the road, and, bound to the
wheels, were a coachman and a footman, clad in gorgeous
liveries. The coachman was fat and florid, the footman
a particularly fine specimen of flunkeydom, and their faces,
as the light of my lamps fell upon them&mdash;they could not
speak, for they were both gagged as well as bound&mdash;were
so convulsed with terror, that I could see they did not
look upon me as a friend. As I dismounted from my car
to go to their assistance, I heard a dismal wail from the
roof of the vehicle and, looking up, I perceived a portly
old lady perched upon the uncomfortable eminence.</p>

<p>I made an attempt to explain that my intentions were
purely pacific, but as I could elicit nothing from the old
lady but appeals to spare her life, I turned my attention
to the two men, and speedily released them from their
bonds. By the time they were loose they had realized
that I was a friend; but it was some time before I
managed to obtain from them an account of how they
got into such a mess. Even when their powers of speech
had returned they were unable to give a lucid account
of the affair.</p>

<p>Of course it was the work of the Pirate. They had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
been returning with their mistress&mdash;the old lady on the
roof of the brougham&mdash;from some local coming-of-age
festivities, when they had met the rascal. He had bound
the servants, set the horses free, and, after robbing the
old lady of all the jewellery she wore, he had compelled
her to climb to the position where I discovered her,
threatening to return and kill her if she moved from her
position for an hour. It needed much persuasion before
she ventured to descend from her perch; but with the
assistance of the coachman, I managed to get her inside
the brougham, and further assisting in securing the two
horses, I left them.</p>

<p>This incident delayed me for nearly half an hour, and
it was a good deal past one before I again set out on my
quest. The brougham had been stopped just near a bye-road,
and as the footman had assured me that the Pirate
had taken this path when he departed, I thought I would
follow. I could see for myself that a motor-car had
passed that way, for the thunderstorm of the previous day
had left the roads heavy in places, and the marks of his
tyres were plainly visible.</p>

<p>I had followed the road for about a couple of miles
further when I came once more upon some of the
Pirate's victims. These, too, were returning from the
same function at which the old lady had been a guest,
when they fell into the clutches of the Pirate. In this
case my assistance was not required, for the two young
ladies of the party had recovered sufficiently from their
fright to have already set at liberty their male companion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and the coachman. They told me of their experiences,
and after I had heard them, I thought that Forrest's idea
that the Pirate was a madman more likely than I had
done previously.</p>

<p>When stopped by the Pirate, the husband of one of
the ladies had shown fight until he had been felled by
a blow from the butt end of a revolver. The coachman
had discreetly made no resistance. Then, after securing
the jewels the women wore, the Pirate had displayed a
freakish humour quite new to his character. He had
insisted upon the two women dancing for his amusement
in the road, threatening to shoot the husband if they did
not comply with his request. They assured me that he
had sat chuckling with laughter, and urging them on
with all sorts of wild threats, until they fell from exhaustion.
They were splashed with mud from head to
foot, and their dainty frocks presented a sorry sight. In
addition they told me that they could barely stand, for
their feet were cut to pieces, since, at the first steps of
the weird dance, their slippers had stuck in the mud, and
they were given no opportunity to stop and recover them.</p>

<p>I did not wait to hear more than the barest outline
of the story, for I learned that he had left them not more
than ten minutes before my arrival on the scene, and
with the heavy roads, I thought there was at least a
chance of some lucky accident bringing me face to face
with my quarry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>A HOT SCENT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">I ran</span> on through the night, but I could not make any
great progress. I was now involved in a maze of Essex
bye-roads, totally unknown to me, and every few minutes
I was compelled to dismount, and search for the tracks.
I never lost them, however, until I came once more to
a high-road. The curve of the tyre marks at the junction
of the road gave me the direction I needed, and, letting
my car go, in four or five minutes I found myself running
into the electric-lighted streets of a town. The place
was deserted, but eventually I found a policeman, and
of him I inquired whether anything had been seen or
heard of the Pirate. There was no need for me to
describe the appearance of the pirate car. It was as
well-known throughout the land, as the Lord Mayor's
coach, but he had seen nothing of it, and was quite
positive that it had not passed through the town. An
ordinary car had passed about half an hour before my
arrival, and though the constable's description of the car
was not very lucid, it was sufficiently near the mark to
make me think of Mannering.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>"I fancy the man you describe is a friend of mine,"
I said. "Which direction did he take?"</p>

<p>"He went straight along the Colchester road," was
the astonishing reply.</p>

<p>"The Colchester road?" I inquired. "What town
is this, then?"</p>

<p>"This is Chelmsford, sir," he answered, with a
surprise equalling my own.</p>

<p>I could see my unguarded question had awakened
his suspicions of me, so I made haste to remark that
I had not realized how quickly I had travelled, adding
that I might have known there was no other town of
the size thereabouts.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," I added, "that if you had met me
outside the borough you would have had a case for the
Bench in the morning."</p>

<p>"I don't take no heed of speed myself, sir, when the
roads is clear," he remarked; "but when the traffic's
thick, it's another matter."</p>

<p>I thought his sound common sense deserved a reward.
Anyway it got one, and with a cheerful good night,
I set my car going at a pace which made me hope
that any other constable I chanced to meet would
prove as intelligent as he from whom I had just
parted. It is about twenty-two miles from Chelmsford
to Colchester, and, in spite of the greasy state of
parts of the road, I managed the distance in thirty
minutes.</p>

<p>Every one of those minutes I expected to be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to overtake Mannering; but I saw nothing of him, and
by the time I came to Colchester, I began to fancy that
he must have given me the slip at some bye-road. From
my inquiries at Colchester, I learned, however, that I
was still on the right scent; but I was mightily puzzled
to discover that though he was driving the old car which
he had always declared was unable to compass more than
twelve or fourteen miles an hour, he was still half an
hour ahead of me.</p>

<p>He was still going away from town, and I followed.
There is no need for me to give in any detail particulars
of my journey that night. Day was breaking when
I came into Ipswich, and it was broad daylight when
I passed through the long, untidy street of Wickham
Market. Mannering still kept ahead, and I followed
doggedly. I heard of him at Saxmundham, but when
I inquired at Blythburgh, I found I had missed him, and
I had to hark back to Yoxford before I got on his track
again. He had taken the side route to Halesworth,
through which he had passed in the direction of Beccles.
By this time he was an hour ahead of me, and, as he
had left Beccles by the Yarmouth road, I went ahead
as fast as I dared. It was not quite my highest speed,
for by this time I was both tired and hungry, and the
strain of travelling over unknown roads at a high speed
at night made my head swim. I knew that unless I
could soon get food and rest I should soon be fit for
nothing. So immediately I reached Yarmouth, I went
to a hotel, ordered breakfast, indulged in a hot bath while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
it was preparing, and went to sleep in my chair directly
I had eaten the meal.</p>

<p>The waiter awakened me about ten. I went down
to the beach and indulged in a swim, and, returning
to the hotel, amazed the waiter by ordering and doing
justice to a second breakfast before taking my departure.</p>

<p>On leaving the hotel, my first consideration was to
get my tank refilled, and, that done, I sent off a couple
of wires, one to Evie and the other addressed to Forrest,
at my own place, telling each of them to communicate
with me at Sutgrove Hall if anything happened, for it
was my intention to call at my home if I could possibly
manage to do so.</p>

<p>My next business was to search for traces of Mannering
in Yarmouth, but it was some time before I ascertained
that the man I imagined to be he, had left by the coast
road through Caister. It was a tedious job to track him
through the Norfolk lanes, for he had turned and doubled
as if anxious to throw a pursuer off the scent, and it was
one o'clock before I eventually struck the high-road
between Norwich and Cromer. There I finally lost
him, owing chiefly to the fact that the day was fine, and
a large number of motor-cars were on the road in consequence.</p>

<p>By this time I was beginning to think my impulsive
action to be more than a little foolish, but in order that
my journey should not be altogether wasted, I determined
to run on to Cromer, lunch there, and afterwards proceed
to Sheringham, near which delightful village my home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
was situated, and seize the opportunity to make arrangements
with my aunt for Evie's visit.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, in half an hour's time,
I walked into the dining-room of the Royal Hotel at
Cromer. You may judge of my surprise when I saw
Mannering seated at a table at one of the windows. He
observed my entrance, and, rising, greeted me heartily.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Sutgrove!" he said. "This is indeed a
welcome surprise. I had not the slightest idea you were
in this part of the country."</p>

<p>"If you had, I presume you would not have chosen
it for the scene of your exploits," I replied.</p>

<p>The expression of astonishment which spread over
his features at my rejoinder was so perfect that I felt
all my suspicions begin to crumble away.</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," he remarked.</p>

<p>His manner was either the result of one of the best
pieces of acting I had ever seen in my life, or due to
absolute unconsciousness of my meaning. It made me
remember that though there were undoubtedly suspicious
circumstances connecting him with the Motor Pirate,
yet so far there was not one iota of direct evidence. I
thought it best to temporize.</p>

<p>"Oh," I remarked; "I was only referring to your
attempts to cut the records with your old car."</p>

<p>He smiled calmly before replying. "You may be
nearer the truth than you think. I've had a new motor
fixed in the car&mdash;an idea of my own, and I find she
travels at quite a decent pace. That's why I left home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
last night. After the rain I thought the roads would
certainly be clear enough to give me the opportunity of
making a fair test. The engine is a model of the one
I have designed for the new car which I mentioned&mdash;last
night was it? No; the night before."</p>

<p>I was fairly staggered at his assurance. His demeanour
was entirely without the suggestion of his being in any
way aware that he was an object of suspicion.</p>

<p>"Were you not afraid of meeting the Pirate? I
heard he was abroad last night," I said.</p>

<p>"Afraid!" he remarked witheringly. "Afraid!
All I am afraid of is, that some of your Scotland Yard
friends will be beforehand with me in his capture, and
that is an adventure which has a particular appeal to me,
since he left his mark upon me here." He tapped his
shoulder significantly. "I have promised myself to
repay this injury with interest."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose we are as likely to meet him here
as anywhere," I ventured to remark.</p>

<p>"I hope so," he answered. "But I am not stopping
here for long. I've taken a bed for the night,
because I feel confoundedly tired after last night's
run. But what brings you down here? Are you
motoring?"</p>

<p>"In the first place I wanted a word with you," I
replied.</p>

<p>"With me?" The amazement in his voice was
obvious.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said; "that is my principal object."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how did you discover my address? I left no
word with any one."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, we have plenty of time to talk," he replied.
"If there's any little difficulty in which I can be of any
assistance, I need hardly assure you I am at your service.
But hadn't you better have lunch first?" He lowered
the tone of his voice. "Unless you wish the waiters to
become acquainted with your affairs, I should think what
you have to say could be much better said outside.
Neither pier nor esplanade are much frequented at this
time of the year."</p>

<p>The suggestion was so natural and reasonable that,
after a moment's consideration, I decided to accept it.</p>

<p>All through the meal he chatted as easily as if
there was not the slightest possibility of anything happening
to interrupt the friendship which had always
ostensibly existed between us. The longer we talked,
the more puzzled I became. His manners were so
natural, so fearless, that it was quite impossible for me
to believe that I was sitting at lunch with the Motor
Pirate. He was very curious to know how I had learned
of his intention to come to Cromer, and I was induced
to tell him of my experiences on the previous night. I
watched his face keenly while I narrated the stories of
the Pirate's victims. He listened quite gravely, not
even the ghost of a smile crossing his face when I told
him of the ludicrous pictures presented by the old lady
and her two servants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is no laughing matter," he observed. "The
rascal was bad enough when he confined his attentions
to men; but now he has taken to bestowing them upon
women, he deserves no mercy, and when I am able to
get upon his track, he will get none."</p>

<p>"Then you are really hoping to join in the hunt?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I'll let you into my secret. At
my place at St. Stephens, I had a car which only wanted
one minor detail to make it complete. I have known
for months, that if I could supply that detail, I should
be in possession of a car which would outpace even the
Pirate's. For months I've racked my brains over it. A
week ago an idea occurred to me. I worked it out. I
tried it for the first time last night. It has proved to
be a success. The day after to-morrow I shall join in
the pursuit of the Motor Pirate, so if your Scotland Yard
friend does not make haste, he will be too late."</p>

<p>"What power do you propose to use?" I asked.
"Petrol?"</p>

<p>He laughed before replying. "A month ago I
would have told nobody; but to-day there is no need of
secrecy; my drawings are all ready for deposit at the
Patent Office, so there is no chance of any one forestalling
me."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" I said.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to tell anybody else just yet," he
said; and as I nodded my acquiescence, he continued,
"My new motor is on an entirely novel principle. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
is a turbine engine, worked by the expansion of liquid
hydrogen."</p>

<p>"What?" I gasped. The idea was so novel that I
could not grasp it. He lifted his hand, checking the
questions which started to my lips.</p>

<p>"No. No questions, if you please: because, if you
ask any, I shall not answer them. Meanwhile, you
have not yet told me how you learned of my presence
here?"</p>

<p>I related how, in the course of my inquiries at
Chelmsford, I had ascertained that a person so like
himself had passed through the town, that I had determined
to attempt to overtake him, little thinking the
chase would prove so stern.</p>

<p>He chaffingly congratulated me on my tracking
powers, and expressed regret that I had not made my
appearance earlier, so that we might have arranged a
race; and by the time we had finished lunch, I was as
completely convinced as I had ever been of anything in
my life, that he had no connection whatsoever with the
Pirate. Still, I was none the less determined to tackle
him upon the subject of the influence which Evie declared
he exerted over her, so when the meal was over,
we left the hotel together and, seeing from the front
that the pier was practically deserted, I led the way to
the far end, determined to have a complete explanation.</p>

<p>He was silent during our walk. So was I, for I was
deliberating how best to introduce the subject. As it
happened, he made the task easy for me, as after finding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
a comfortable seat and lighting a cigarette, he turned to
me with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, old fellow, what is it you have on your
mind? Out with it!"</p>

<p>I told him&mdash;told him fully and frankly everything
that Evie had mentioned to me concerning him, and I
finished by warning him that I was determined to
exercise the right she had given me to protect her. He
listened to me attentively and, one might have thought,
even sympathetically. When I had concluded, he sat
silent awhile; then, looking me full in the eyes, he
remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose, Sutgrove, if I tell you that this story of
the influence I am supposed to exercise over Miss Maitland
is absolute news to me, you will not believe
me?"</p>

<p>I was staggered, and my astonishment must have
been visible in my face, for he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may be surprised, but not half so much as I
have been, by what you have told me. Really, the
whole story sounds the maddest farrago of nonsense I
have ever heard."</p>

<p>I was about to make an angry retort, but he checked
me with a gesture&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not mean any offence," he said; "for I can
quite understand what your feelings on the subject must
be. I, no more than yourself, would tolerate any unwarrantable
interference such as you describe. It is just
as well that you should have mentioned the matter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
me, however, for you will know so much better how
to proceed."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Why, what else than that you will not waste any
time before obtaining medical advice for Miss Maitland,"
he replied.</p>

<p>I felt a grey horror creeping over me&mdash;a horror that
tied my tongue, to think that Evie&mdash;my Evie&mdash;might
prove to be&mdash;mad. Again, he must have divined my
thoughts, for he said reassuringly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must not take too serious a view of the case.
Miss Maitland is of a highly nervous temperament, and,
I should imagine, rather prone to hysteria." Then,
rising, he clapped me on the shoulder, "Take a cheerful
view, Sutgrove. I'll bet you ten to one that her doctor
will inform you that marriage will provide a complete
cure."</p>

<p>His tone was so hearty, so friendly, that I instinctively
grasped his hand, and he returned my grip.</p>

<p>The subject was not resumed; and, as we walked
back to the hotel, I was completely convinced that I had
been an unutterable cad ever to allow a single doubt concerning
him to enter my mind, much less to harbour
there.</p>

<p>I left him at the hotel door and went in search of
my car to continue my journey to Sutgrove Hall. He
was still standing where I parted from him when I swept
past, and he waved his hand to me, a smile upon his face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>RELATES HOW THE PIRATE HOLDS UP AN AUGUST
PERSONAGE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>I reached</span> my destination about five, and found, as I
hoped, a telegram awaiting my arrival. It read&mdash;</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ever so much better. Do not worry about me.
Cannot spare you for long though. Lots of love.&mdash;E."</p></div>

<p>With my mind very much relieved, I was able to
devote my attention to my aunt, who was full of
questions as to the reason for my unexpected arrival and
equally eager for a full account of my doings during the
past six months, during which time, she assured me, I
had grossly neglected my duties, especially by my failure
to keep her adequately posted regarding my engagement.</p>

<p>I was anxious, after reading Evie's wire, to start forthwith
for St. Albans; my aunt was equally anxious that
I should remain the night at Sutgrove, and while we
were arguing the point, a second telegram arrived, which
settled the matter. I tore open the envelope and read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Meet the 8.49 at Cromer with motor. Do not fail.
Most important.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forrest.</span>"</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>The message had been handed in at Liverpool Street
at 4.50, and I wondered what could have happened to
necessitate Forrest's presence in Norfolk. There was
little use speculating, however, and I settled down to
satiate, if it were possible, my aunt's curiosity.</p>

<p>She was duly impressed by such of my adventures as
I thought fit to relate, but she was not neglectful of
what she considered her duties as hostess and, in spite
of the fact that I had eaten a hearty lunch about two, I
was able shortly after seven to do adequate justice to the
early dinner which she provided for me. I left home
soon after eight, and, in consequence of my impatience,
had to wait ten minutes on the Cromer platform for the
arrival of the train.</p>

<p>As the engine drew into the station, I saw Forrest's
head thrust out of the window of one of the carriages,
and, before the train had come to a standstill, he had
leaped from the door and was at my side. He was for
him unusually excited, and, without reply to my greeting,
save with a silent hand grip, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Seen anything of Mannering?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I replied directly. "I lunched with
him, to-day. He's stopping at the Royal."</p>

<p>"That's a bit of luck," replied the detective.
"Come along;" and he pushed on in advance of me
through the barrier.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" I asked, as I caught him up
in the station yard.</p>

<p>"I hold a warrant for his arrest, and I am desirous of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
executing it at the earliest possible moment, that's all,"
he replied.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my ears. "What in the world
for?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What should it be for?" said Forrest, with a touch
of sarcasm in the tone of his voice.</p>

<p>"He cannot be the Motor Pirate. It is impossible.
He could not have deceived me so completely," I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I would stake everything I hope for in the future,
as well as everything I possess at the present moment,
that he is though," returned the detective with conviction.
"But we must not waste time. Take me to the hotel."</p>

<p>Without stopping to argue the point, I jumped on my
car, Forrest took the seat beside me, and we proceeded to
the Royal.</p>

<p>"Leave the car and come with me, I may want your
assistance," he said, as we pulled up at the entrance to
the hotel.</p>

<p>He sprang out the moment I stopped and ran briskly
up the steps. A porter was in the hall, and to him
Forrest turned.</p>

<p>"I want to see a Mr. Mannering, who is stopping here,
at once, and I do not wish to be announced," he said.</p>

<p>The man walked across to the office and made an
inquiry of the clerk, then returning, announced that
Mannering had left an hour previously.</p>

<p>"Left?" said Forrest, and his jaw fell. He stepped
across to the office himself, only to learn that though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Mannering had booked a room for the night, he had
after dinner called for his bill, paid it, and left on his
motor, without giving any reason for his alteration of
plans.</p>

<p>Forrest stalked out of the hotel, his brow heavy with
thought. I followed him. He stepped on to the car,
and, taking my seat, I asked him tersely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"St. Albans," he replied with brevity equal to my
own, and without further question we were off.</p>

<p>"Don't mind taking a few risks," he said presently.
"The sooner we can get there the better I shall be
pleased."</p>

<p>Then, leaning back in his seat, he asked me to tell
him how I happened to learn of Mannering's presence in
Cromer, and what he had said to convince me that he
was in no way connected with the Pirate. So while we
were still running at a moderate pace, I gave him a brief
history of my adventures of the previous night. Before
I had concluded, however, the road ahead seemed clear,
and, pulling my mask over my face, I jammed on my
highest speed and conversation became impossible.</p>

<p>Forrest pulled his cap down over his eyes and, turning
his coat-collar about his ears, settled himself apparently
to slumber. Within half an hour the lights of Norwich
sparkled in front of us, and it became necessary to slacken
speed. Forrest immediately resumed the conversation at
the point where we had broken off, and questioned me
closely with regard to what Mannering had said to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Once and again I endeavoured to ascertain what had
induced him to take out the warrant; but he would not
satisfy my curiosity, declaring that it was of more
importance that he should know all that I could tell him
first. There seemed little likelihood of my learning
anything, for we soon left Norwich behind us, and were
running at full speed on the road to Thetford and Newmarket,
slackening speed only slightly as we swept
through the villages and trusting to the continuous toot-toot
of the horn to clear our path. Our progress was
uninterrupted until we had reached and left the little
town of Attleborough five or six miles behind us, when
Forrest was afforded an opportunity, much to his chagrin,
of giving me the reasons for his haste.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I may remark, that the occurrence which
afforded this opportunity came very near depriving me of
the chance of hearing anything from anybody, or him
from ever opening his lips again, for while we swept
along at our top speed there was a sudden hissing sound,
a sudden succession of jars, and the car swerved violently,
nearly overturning. I jammed on both my breaks, and
by good fortune the car did not overturn. I guessed
what had happened, and there was no need for me to get
a light to make sure&mdash;my sense of touch informed me
that the off back tyre was as flat as a pancake.</p>

<p>I hoped that the injury was only slight, but my hopes
faded the moment I examined the injury. The tyre had
picked up a curved and pointed piece of iron, and had
been irreparably damaged. No patching was of any use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
There was nothing for it but to replace the tyre with
a new one. Fortunately, I was prepared with a spare
outer cover as well as inner tubes, and, with a muttered
curse, I threw off my coat and set about the job. Then
when that was done, and it took me a good hour to
complete the task, I discovered, on restarting the car, that
a further misfortune had befallen us. Either owing to
the jumping of the car when the tyre went, or more
likely because of the sudden application, the footbreak
had seized, and the transmission was so far injured that
I could not get the car along above seven or eight miles
an hour. I did my best to put the damage right. I lay
on my back in the middle of the road, and used all the
language approved by the most fluent members of the
Automobile Club for use on such occasions, but entirely
without result. Exactly where we were I did not know,
and, after I had relieved my feelings, I thought it best to
jog along until we came to some town where it would
be possible to get skilled assistance.</p>

<p>And it was while we were progressing in this humdrum
fashion that Forrest confided to me the reasons for
his anxiety.</p>

<p>"In the first place," he said, "your theory as to the
stud found by Mannering's servants proved to be correct.
It was Winter's. I arrived at St. Albans the first thing
this morning, and, after getting your note, went straight
away and interviewed the girls. They handed me the
trinket. I took it to Winter, and he identified it. He
will swear to it anywhere. By the time I had done this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
your wire for me had arrived, and your man, having seen
me go into Winter's house, brought it on. I took the
next train to town and went straight to the Yard,
thankful that at last I was able to report something
definite. Besides, I wanted to take a warrant without
any one being aware of it, and I knew I could manage
that better in London than in the country. Well, I
called at the Yard, ran across to Bow Street and got my
warrant, and returned to the Yard in order to instruct
a couple of our men who had been placed at my disposal.
While I was there particulars came to hand of a feat
which throws all the other doings of the Pirate into the
shade. You mentioned, I think, that Mannering, when
he told Miss Maitland that he was going away, said that
all England would be talking of him."</p>

<p>"She said so," I replied doubtfully; "but she was so
excited&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She was probably correct in her recollection of what
passed," he said. "If further proof were wanted to
connect your friend with the Motor Pirate, those words
would be sufficient. If what I know leaks out, the Pirate
will fill the popular mind more to-morrow than he has
done in the past even. Yesterday morning, within six
miles of Sandringham, he held up"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"I
must mention no names&mdash;he held up, let me say, an
August Personage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The King?" I cried.</p>

<p>"An August Personage," remarked Forrest, severely,
"in broad daylight."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me hear all about it?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can tell you everything, for
so far I only know the particulars wired to the Yard.
But the story is complete enough to enable me to do what
I have hitherto failed in, and that is, complete the
necessary identification of our friend Mannering. And
curiously enough, it is owing to the keen powers of
observation possessed by the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The August Personage," I reminded him, a trifle
maliciously as he hesitated.</p>

<p>Forrest laughed. "Quite right, you score that time,"
he remarked, before resuming his tale. "Owing to the
August Personage's keen powers of observation, I am able
to lay my finger on the one point which has puzzled me,
namely, the manner by which Mannering has managed
to escape suspicion. It is a simple trick. So simple, in
fact, that I cannot conceive how I managed to overlook
such a possibility for so long. However, you shall hear
the facts as they were told to me, and judge for yourself
with what transparent means we have been hoodwinked
by the rascal. The August Personage, who, as you are
probably aware, has been staying at Sandringham for
some days past, has been in the habit of taking a ride on
one of his cars whenever the roads were in good condition,
accompanied only by his chauffeur. This morning
he started for the customary run shortly after eleven, with
the intention of taking a circular trip through Hunstanton,
Burnham, Docking and Bircham, and returning for
luncheon. The intention was not fulfilled since, before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
reaching Hunstanton, the Pirate made his appearance,
and approaching as usual from behind, overtook the
August motor. The August driver did not at first take
any notice of the approaching car, but, merely imagining
that the driver had recognized him, and felt some
delicacy at passing, he signalled with his hand for the
stranger to go ahead. What was his surprise to hear the
stranger in a loud voice bid him stop his car. He turned
to look at the audacious person who had dared take such
unwarrantable liberty, and at once observed with whom
he had to deal. The Pirate had in his hand a revolver,
which was levelled at the August head. The August face
flushed with anger, and turning away, he contemptuously
took no notice of the summons. The Pirate thereupon
fired two shots, aimed, fortunately, neither at the August
Personage nor at the chauffeur, but at the tyres of the
back wheels. The aim was good, the tyres ran down at
once, and the August Personage found progress on the
rims to be so uncomfortable that he thought it desirable
to stop. The stranger ranged alongside, and the chauffeur,
rising from his seat, was about to throw himself at the
throat of the assailant, when his August master laid a
hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"'No, no,' he said, 'I can easily get another car,
but I do not know that I could replace my chauffeur.'</p>

<p>"Thereupon the Pirate observed, 'I think, sir, there is
so much wisdom in your remark that, in spite of my
necessities, I almost feel inclined to forego my usual toll
in your case.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"The August Personage, whose coolness had never
for a moment deserted him, replied imperturbably&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Having robbed me of a morning's enjoyment, it
seems to me there is nothing of any particular value left
for you to take.'</p>

<p>"'Then, sir,' replied the rascal, 'you will be doubtless
glad to purchase my immediate disappearance with
the contents of the August pockets?'</p>

<p>"August was not the word he used, but it was one
which showed that he was acquainted with the personality
of his victim.</p>

<p>"The August Personage shrugged his shoulders, and,
searching his pockets, could produce nothing but a
cigarette case and a button. To show his <i>sang-froid</i>, I
need only remark that when he produced the latter
article he laughed heartily and said to the chauffeur&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I hope, P&mdash;&mdash;, you have something to add to the
contents of my pockets, or I fear this too eager gentleman
will destroy our front tyres as well as the back.'</p>

<p>"The chauffeur had some loose gold, a silver matchbox,
and a watch, and when these were produced, speaking
with the same nonchalance he had retained throughout,
the August Personage remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I fear you have drawn a blank this time, Mr.
Pirate; for, upon my word, that is the best I can do for you.'</p>

<p>"The Pirate took the articles. Then he raised his hat.
'I take,' he said, 'the August word as readily as I take
these souvenirs of this memorable meeting,' and with
these words, he pulled a lever and was speedily out of sight."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Jove!" I muttered. "The fellow's audacity is
almost past belief. But you said something of observations
made by the August victim?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Forrest. "The chauffeur was much too
agitated to notice anything, but his master was not. He
observed four things. First, that the Pirate was a man
of about six feet in height."</p>

<p>"Mannering is five feet eleven and a quarter in his
socks," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Secondly, that his hair was black. Thirdly, that the
nails of the right hand, with which he took his plunder,
were bitten to the quick."</p>

<p>"The identification becomes nearly perfect," I
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, that the car was originally a two-seated
car, with a tonneau body, but that the seat had been set
back, and the bonnet was enclosed by metal plates shaped
into the form of the bow of a canoe, and bolted together
in a manner which gave the impression that they might
easily be removed. Why," continued the detective, "I
did not think of so obvious a solution of the Pirate's
mysterious disappearances before I cannot imagine. It
is the trick the black flag merchants have practised since
the days of Captain Kidd."</p>

<p>I was silent. I could only wonder at my own
blindness. Then an excuse occurred to me.</p>

<p>"After all," I remarked, "we only met him in the
dark."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>WE PLAN AN AMBUSH</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Forrest</span> had just concluded his story when the lights of
Thetford gleamed in our eyes. The time was 12.30.
The last train was gone. The inhabitants were all in
bed, and there we were, stranded with a broken car, and
no means of putting it right. Forrest would not despair,
however, and after some difficulty we managed, with the
assistance of the local police, to knock up a man who
was locally reputed to know all about motors. He was
a little surly at first, but the inducement I offered him to
make an attempt to put the transmission right, was sufficient
to dissipate his very natural disgust at being disturbed
in his beauty sleep. Fortunately his local reputation had
reasonable foundation. He was a very capable mechanician,
and the way he set about the job gave me great hopes
that the car would run as well as ever when he had
done with it. And my expectations were gratified. In
less than an hour he had completed the repairs. I paid
him and asked him to remain up for ten minutes in case
we had another breakdown, telling him that after that
period had elapsed, he would be at liberty to return to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
bed. Whether he waited the ten minutes or not I do
not know, for by that time we were halfway to Newmarket,
flying through the darkness at a pace which two
months previously I would not have dared venture upon
in broad daylight. And right onward to St. Albans, we
kept it up, reaching the ancient town just as the birds
began to twitter in the hedges at the first grey light of
early dawn. At St. Albans we stopped at the police-station.
A man was waiting at the door.</div>

<p>"Any news?" asked Forrest.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"You know where to bring it?" asked my companion.</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"Let us get on home," said Forrest to me.</p>

<p>As I wheeled my vehicle into my yard I thought I
should drop. The strain of that rush through the night,
expecting every moment that something would give way,
had been tremendous, and the moment the tension was
relaxed I shook like an aspen leaf. When I tried to get
in at my own door I found I could not fit the latch-key,
and was obliged to hand it to the detective. He saw
what was the matter with me, and the moment we were
inside, he led the way to my study, thrust me down into
a chair and mixed me a whisky-and-soda. I was never
more grateful for a drink in my life. It pulled me
together, and in less time than I had conceived possible,
I felt as if I could have managed another seventy-five
miles without a halt.</p>

<p>The moment he saw my nerves were steady again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Forrest proposed that we should get something to eat. I
declared that I did not want anything.</p>

<p>"When you haven't time for sleep, the next best
thing is to feed well if you want to keep fit," he
remarked. "Besides, I am as hungry as a hunter has a
right to be."</p>

<p>"That settles it," I laughed. "We shall have to
forage for ourselves. The servants are all asleep."</p>

<p>We found our way to the larder and made a hearty
meal on a cold pie we found there; and directly we
had finished, we set out forthwith in the direction of
Mannering's home. As soon as we arrived opposite
the house, Forrest paused and gave a low whistle. It was
answered immediately by a man dressed as a labourer,
who made his appearance from behind the hedge opposite
the house.</p>

<p>"Any one been here to-night, Laver?" asked Forrest.</p>

<p>"No one," the man answered. "The servants
turned in about ten after locking up. No signs of any
one about the place since."</p>

<p>"That's all right," grunted Forrest. "We shall be
ready for him when he does come. Have you got the
tools?"</p>

<p>The man was proceeding to scramble through the
hedge when Forrest checked him.</p>

<p>"Better stay where you are," he advised. "Keep out
of sight, and if I whistle, come at once."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," replied the man, as he handed through
a gap in the hedge a small chamois leather bag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>I had no idea as to what steps Forrest proposed to
adopt in order to effect the arrest, so I asked him, and he
explained briefly his plan of campaign.</p>

<p>"One can see," he remarked, "that Mannering feels
so confident of the completeness of his disguise that he
will have no hesitation about returning. I am reckoning,
too, upon there being an element of truth in the story
he has told you about the construction of his motor, in
which case his own workshop would be the only place
where he would be able to refill his tank. We shall be
able to decide that point in a very few minutes. If we
do find any plant for the production of liquid gases, we can
count upon catching our man within a very few hours."</p>

<p>"Unless he smells a rat, and makes for some convenient
port and gets out of the country," I remarked.</p>

<p>"That eventuality is provided against," remarked the
detective. "His description is in the hands of the police
at every port in the kingdom, and even if he changes the
colour of his hair, I don't think he will manage to get
away. What I propose is, that we shall remain concealed
in his coach-house and await his return."</p>

<p>"How are we going to get in?" I inquired.</p>

<p>Forrest took a bunch of skeleton keys from the bag
Laver had handed to him and dangled them before his eyes.</p>

<p>"There's not a burglar in the kingdom is better
provided," he remarked, and set to work upon the lock
forthwith.</p>

<p>The lock was an ordinary one, and his efforts were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>speedily successful. The door swung open, and we
entered eagerly a bare, stone-paved coach-house. Opposite
the door by which we had entered from the road
was a similar door, which gave upon the inner yard. On
the left, a large sliding door had been fixed in place of the
wall which had divided the coach-house from the stables.
Relocking the door by which we had entered, Forrest
led the way to the door on the left. It was unfastened,
and as it swung back a cry of amazement sprang to
my lips.</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!" said the detective warningly.</p>

<p>But I could not have repressed the cry, for there before
me stood a replica of the car I had seen on two occasions.
There was only one point of difference at first apparent.
The pirate car had been black. This one was built of
aluminium and gleamed silvery white. But although the
lines were very similar, I soon came to the conclusion that
the car we saw before us was not the one which the
Pirate had used when engaged upon his nefarious work.
One glance at the tyres convinced me that they had
never been upon the road, and I fancied that the wheels
were smaller and the lines of the body finer altogether.
I pointed these things out to Forrest, who, while agreeing
that this particular car could not have been the one
which had been responsible for holding up the "August
Personage" on the previous day, would not commit
himself further.</p>

<p>We did not spend much time upon a close examination
of the car, for the other contents of the building
claimed our attention. We found ourselves in a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
workshop. There were no windows in the walls, but
the place was amply illuminated by a skylight which ran
along nearly the whole length of the northern slope of
the roof. On the right of the large door by which we
had entered the inner shop was a small room, which had
probably once served as a harness-room, for through this
another door gave on to the yard, though this exit was
evidently never used, for the door was fixed by screws.
The contents were a couple of broken chairs, and some
coats and rugs hung upon hooks upon the walls, together
with a miscellaneous assortment of odds and ends upon a
shelf. I gave merely a cursory glance at the contents of
this apartment, for my attention had been attracted by a
plant of machinery, which occupied the far end of the
large room. As it happened, I had once had an opportunity
of inspecting the laboratory of the Royal Institution, and
I recognized at once that Mannering had set up an installation
for the preparation of some one or other of the
liquid gases. Without this experience, I doubt whether
it would have been possible for me to guess even the
purpose for which the plant had been devised. As it
was, I had no hesitation in discovering the receiver into
which the liquid gas was distilled; and when I let a little
of the liquid with which it was filled run into a glass
which I found handy, and saw the air fall in a shower of
tiny snow-flakes as the stuff evaporated, I knew that
Mannering had told me the exact truth when he had
informed me that liquid hydrogen supplied the power for
his new car.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Once satisfied on this point, I examined the other
contents of the place. I do not think there is any need
to particularize all that we discovered, even if my memory
served me. Practically the workshop contained a sufficient
engineering equipment to build such a car as stood in the
centre, though I judged that there was no convenience
for the forging of the parts of the motor.</p>

<p>Still, as I pointed out to Forrest, there was nothing
in all these discoveries to negative the truth of the story
Mannering had told me about his being engaged in building
a car which should serve to outpace the Pirate car,
but he would not listen to any theorising on the subject.</p>

<p>"He can tell that story to the jury," he said, as he
significantly drew a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and
clinked them together. Then he proceeded to investigate
the contents of the harness-room, while I went back to
the new car and began a careful examination of the
engines. The whole mechanism was, however, so novel
to me, that I could only surmise as to the method of its
working. I did notice, however, that the driving and
steering gear varied very little from that of my own car,
so far as it was controlled by the levers and wheel, while
the breaks seemed to be particularly powerful. There
was only seating accommodation for two, and judging
from the size of the tank which was fitted behind the
seat, I judged that Mannering contemplated runs over
distances which would make large demands upon his
supply of liquid gas.</p>

<p>At the moment I made this discovery, I heard Forrest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
call to me in an excited whisper, and going across to
him, I found him contemplating with keen interest a
dirty piece of rope.</p>

<p>"Look here, Sutgrove," he said; "this is the piece of
cord with which he trussed me up on the occasion when
he dropped me into the pond. Compare it with this"&mdash;he
kicked a coil which lay at his feet&mdash;"and tell me if
they are not identical."</p>

<p>I examined them both, and came to the conclusion
that Forrest was correct in his supposition. Next, mounting
one of the chairs, he proceeded to rummage amongst
the rubbish piled on the shelf. A moment later he
observed triumphantly, albeit in subdued tones, "Another
piece of evidence," and descending from his perch, he
handed me a box of cartridges. A glance at the label
had apparently been enough, nevertheless, to make sure,
he searched again in his pocket, and produced the bullet
which had proved fatal to the poor victim at Towcester.
He compared it with one of the cartridges, and gave a
grunt of content. "I fancy we shall soon obtain sufficient
evidence to hang him," he murmured. Then a
shadow crossed his face. "What an infernal dunderhead
I have been not to suspect him before," he said, and
turning impatiently away, he replaced the box of cartridges
on the shelf, before renewing his systematic examination
of the rest of the contents of the room. The search
revealed nothing further, and at length he desisted.</p>

<p>All the while we were keenly on the alert to detect
any sound which should tell us of the approach of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Mannering's car. But the minutes passed and grew into
hours without a sign. It must have been about five in
the morning when we had entered the coach-house, and
when I saw by my watch that it was nearly ten, I began
to think that in some way or another Mannering had got
warning of the danger that threatened him. I suggested
to Forrest that we might as well leave our hiding-place,
but he would not hear of it.</p>

<p>"I don't leave this building except in his company,
unless I hear that he has been captured elsewhere," he
declared obstinately. "At the same time, don't let me
detain you."</p>

<p>I wanted badly to see Evie, whom I thought might
be getting anxious concerning me; but I hardly liked
the idea of leaving Forrest to tackle Mannering alone
if he should return. However, my first desire triumphed,
so I persuaded Forrest to let me out of the door, promising
to return within as short a time as I could manage.</p>

<p>I hurried first to the Colonel's house, and had a
brief interview with the dear girl, telling her what had
happened and what was likely to happen in the near
future. Next, I went to my own place, and had a basket
packed with a plentiful luncheon, not forgetting to provide
a couple of bottles of champagne, and thus provided
I returned to the coach-house after an absence of less
than an hour.</p>

<p>When in response to my signal Forrest admitted me,
his eyes twinkled with satisfaction as he saw my burden.</p>

<p>"It is truly thoughtful of you," he remarked, as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
lifted the lid of the basket and revealed the contents.
"I only hope our friend will not spoil our picnic by
arriving in the middle of it."</p>

<p>The better to avoid any such <i>contretemps</i>, we set about
our meal immediately with very good appetites. When
we had finished, I do not know how Forrest felt, but I
was confoundedly drowsy. I tried all sorts of tricks to
keep my eyes open, but the quiet of the place, the coolness,
and the subdued light of the saddle-room, where
Forrest thought it best for us to remain, were too much
for my powers of resistance and I dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>I must have slumbered for a couple of hours, if not
three, when I was suddenly awakened by a hand placed
on my mouth, while a voice whispered in my ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wake up, man&mdash;wake up! There's no time to
lose."</p>

<p>I came to myself with a start. Forrest had hold of
me, and was shaking me violently. At the same moment
I became aware of the throb of an approaching motor.</p>

<p>Recognizing the sound, I turned to the detective.</p>

<p>"That's Mannering," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied my companion. "I could swear to
the sound anywhere."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>GONE AWAY</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class='smcap'>Don't</span> stir an inch until I give the signal," whispered
Forrest in my ear, as soon as he saw I was fully awake.
He was perfectly calm, and he closed the door in order
to conceal us from the sight of any one entering the
workshop.</div>

<p>The car pulled up outside. We heard the grate of
the key in the lock, and the door creak on its hinges,
as it swung open. There was a second grating noise,
and I judged that the door of the inner yard had been
opened by whoever had entered. There followed a few
more pants from the motor, as it passed through the
coach-house into the yard, and then everything was silent.
The outer door shutting with a snap apprized us that the
crucial moment was at hand, and my heart began to
thump as I heard footsteps approaching. Forrest pointed
to a vacant hook over my head, and I recognized why
he had selected the harness-room for our hiding-place.
The footsteps came slowly nearer, then stopped, and a
long low laugh came from the lips of the unseen man.
I thought we must have been discovered in our hiding-place
and glanced at Forrest for instructions. He never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
moved a muscle. He stood poised like a greyhound
about to be slipped from the leash.</p>

<p>The footsteps approached again. The door knob
rattled as a hand was laid upon it. The door flew open.
Forrest darted forward.</p>

<p>I caught one glimpse of Mannering's face, for it was
indeed he, and I saw it become suddenly livid. It was
not the pallor of fear. His eyes flashed. He had doffed
his coat and was holding it in one hand, and quick as
was Forrest's spring, he was equally swift to meet it.
His other hand passed swift as lightning from the door
handle, and catching the edge of the coat, spread the
garment in front of him. Forrest, missing his grip,
plunged heavily into the wide folds of the garment.
Mannering's arms closed as a vice. The door swinging
back had momentarily blocked my passage. I thrust it
open, and had taken one step forward to Forrest's assistance,
when Mannering with a herculean effort, swung
the detective from his feet, and hurled him full at me.
It was a magnificent effort, and I went down with a
crash amongst the remains of the lunch with Forrest on
the top of me. The whole incident had not lasted
twenty seconds, and before either of us could regain our
feet, the door was slammed and locked.</p>

<p>Forrest was the first to regain his feet, and he rushed
at the door furiously. We were trapped. The door
was a strong one of oak, and I remembered that it
fastened by a couple of bolts on the other side. The
detective worried the door like a bear at the bars of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
cage, but he could not move it. He gnashed his teeth,
and he was white with rage. From the other side we
could hear the sound of heavy objects being moved, and
we guessed that our enemy was piling the most massive
articles his workshop contained against the door to make
it more secure.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;n you, Sutgrove!" shouted the detective.
"Don't stop to think, or we shall lose our man after
all. Come, both together."</p>

<p>I saw his intention, and I could understand and
forgive his curse in the excitement of the moment.
Together we hurled ourselves against the door. It did
not move an inch, and a long low chuckle greeted the
attempt from the other side. We tried madly again and
again, but the barrier was immovable.</p>

<p>Then I looked round for some tool which would
enable me to break down the door itself. There were
only the chairs available, and so I tore off the leg of one
of them, and, bidding Forrest stand back, I swung the
piece of wood round my head, and struck as hard as I
could against one of the lower panels of the door. The
improvised club flew into half a dozen fragments, but
the panel had cracked. Forrest had provided himself
meanwhile with a similar club, and directed his blows
so effectively that the panel was driven out. I threw
myself at the gap, trusting to be able to force my way
through.</p>

<p>What I saw filled me with rage. The wheels of the
new car were moving, and right before my eyes the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
disappeared into the outer coach-house. I made an unavailing
attempt to struggle through the aperture, but the
attempt was hopeless. It was too narrow to admit even
my shoulders. Withdrawing, I told Forrest what I had
seen.</p>

<p>"I had entirely forgotten Laver," he remarked, and
putting his whistle to his mouth, he blew it shrill and
clear.</p>

<p>Then together we renewed our attack upon the door.
The sound of a shout from the outside followed by a
pistol shot made us work like madmen, and within a
minute, another panel gave, and we managed to get at
the bolts and draw them. The articles piled against the
door toppled in all directions, as we finally forced our
way out.</p>

<p>We were too late. The outer door was wide open,
and just on the threshold, was Forrest's unfortunate
subordinate lying on the ground, with blood trickling
down his arm. He struggled into a sitting position as
we came out, and pointed up the road in the direction
of St. Albans.</p>

<p>"Gone away, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Hurt?" asked Forrest, pausing as he did so.</p>

<p>"Not much; smashed shoulder, I fancy," remarked
the sufferer philosophically.</p>

<p>"I'll send assistance," said my companion as he
rushed after me into the road, where I stood horror
stricken at what met my gaze.</p>

<p>Fifty yards distant, opposite the entrance gate of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Colonel Maitland's house, the new car was standing still.
It was empty. The gate was open, and even as I
watched, I saw Mannering come out of the gate, bearing
in his arms the helpless figure of a girl. There was no
need to guess who the victim might be. Even before I
saw him appear, I knew intuitively why he had stopped.
Had he not told Evie that on the third day he would return,
bidding her be ready for him?</p>

<p>I rushed forward towards the car, but before I had
covered half the distance which separated me from it, he
was aboard with his burden and I knew pursuit on foot to
be hopeless.</p>

<p>Yet, even as I saw him move away, there flashed
across my brain one means by which I might possibly
get on terms with my enemy. There was just one
chance, and one chance only, of rescuing my darling from
the Pirate, and that chance depended entirely upon the
question as to whether the car upon which Mannering
had returned was fitted with the same sort of motor as
that on which he had departed.</p>

<p>With the haste of a madman I returned to the coach-house
I had just quitted. My hopes fell to zero. There
was an unmistakable scent of petrol about the car. They
rose again, however, upon a closer examination, for I saw
at once that the motor was a turbine, though petrol was
utilized in some way as a means of securing the necessary
heat to secure the expansion of the gas for the starting of
the engine, though I could see that once started, the expanded
hydrogen was, as in the new car, ingeniously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
utilized to produce the necessary heat. I was glad then
that I had spent as much time as I had upon examining the
car upon which the Pirate had escaped, for I was enabled
to see that, if only a supply of the liquid hydrogen were
obtainable, I should be able to put my wild plan into execution.
As it was, the tank was nearly empty, so putting
my shoulder to the car, I shoved it into the workshop
where, unless Mannering had let it run to waste, I knew
I should find a supply of the hydrogen. Thank Heaven,
Mannering had forgot to empty the receiver, and filling
the tank and tightly screwing down the nuts of the covering,
I wheeled the car into the open road. There I saw
Forrest leaning against the wall of the coach-house, a
figure of inexpressible dejection.</p>

<p>"Come and lend a hand!" I shouted.</p>

<p>The light that flashed into his face, as he realized what
I would be at, was extraordinary. He sprang forward at
once to my assistance. Now, in my attempts to get at
the machinery of the car, I had discovered the plates with
which Mannering had been wont to disguise its shape, and
it occurred to me that they performed the further purpose
of diminishing the wind resistance, so that if I wanted to
get the full speed out of the car it would be necessary
to fix them in their places. I immediately set to work to
join up the various sections, leaving Forrest to bolt them
together. We worked like niggers at the job, and it was
nearly completed when a curious sound came down the
breeze. I looked up, and to my surprise I saw the Pirate
once more approaching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look!" I shouted to Forrest in my excitement,
though there was no need to warn him.</p>

<p>Nearer the Pirate came; still nearer. Every moment
I expected to see him pull up and surrender. But it was
a mad hope. He had not the slightest intention of so
obliging us. As he approached, he suddenly increased
his pace and flashed past us at full sixty miles an hour.</p>

<p>Forrest fingered a revolver, but he dared not shoot for
fear the bullet should find the slender form of Evie, who
we saw was huddled close to his side. Mannering laughed
as he passed us and waved his hand in derision.</p>

<p>"There are a couple of masks in the coach-house," I
said quietly to the detective.</p>

<p>He darted into the doorway and returned a moment
later with them, thrusting at the same time a bottle into
his pocket. It took us no time to climb into the car and
as, during his momentary absence, I had succeeded in
starting the engine, we were in a position to move at
once.</p>

<p>For a hundred yards we travelled at the speed at which
we were accustomed to see Mannering while using the car
in the sight of men and in the light of day. Then with
a word of warning to my companion, I pulled at the
change-speed lever. The effect was marvellous. The
car seemed to leap forward and the hedges suddenly transformed
themselves into long green streaks.</p>

<p>A cloud of dust on the road ahead gave the direction
Mannering had taken, so I jammed down the lever to its
limit and commenced the pursuit. At any other time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the idea of chasing the Pirate on one of his own cars
would have delighted me beyond measure, but my thoughts
were too much occupied as to the fate which might await
Evie if we failed to overtake her abductor to allow room
for anything else.</p>

<p>Exactly what speed we made I cannot tell, it must
have been nearer eighty than sixty miles an hour, but the
smoothness of the motion was wonderful, and I felt not
the slightest tremor.</p>

<p>Mannering had disappeared on the Watford road,
and in a few minutes we swept through the north end
of the town and, directed by a boy at the cross roads,
made for Rickmansworth. Forrest took charge of the
horn, and kept it braying continuously. We slackened
speed through Rickmansworth, for the streets were full
of vehicles, and there we learned that the white car was
five minutes ahead. Once clear of the streets I let the
car go again, and we tore away towards Uxbridge. On
reaching the main Oxford road once more a dust cloud
in the distance served as a guide, and informed us that
Mannering had crossed the highway, and gone away in
the direction of Slough. The going was rough for a
while, but I did not slacken pace, though the road was
narrow, and to have met a cart would have meant certain
destruction. The road broadened after a time, and I
fancied we were gaining, for the dust cloud seemed
nearer. We skirted Slough to the east, the guiding
cloud bearing towards Dachet. Darting through that
little riverside town at a pace which set the police whistles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
blowing behind us, we came to the bridge across the
Thames, and here we were informed that our quarry
was barely a minute ahead, and running in the direction
of Egham. A mile further on, at a straight piece of
road, we first sighted the fugitives, and a cry of triumph
escaped my lips. It was a little premature, however.
Once again the silver car turned into a bye-road so
winding that I was compelled, much against my will,
to slacken speed. Then once more we came out upon
a main road, to find our quarry not more than a hundred
yards away as we swept out into the broad highway.</p>

<p>And here, looking back, Mannering for the first time
learned that we were on his track. At that moment,
too, commenced a race which, I venture to think, will
not soon be equalled in the history of the motor world.
At all events, I trust it will never be my lot to take part
in any similar trial of speed, at least, with such issues
depending upon the result. Upon emerging from the
bye-road we were a mile from Egham, and knowing
the road, I asked Forrest to glance at his watch. The
way was clear before us, and three minutes and a quarter
later, we flashed through the railway arch at Sunningdale
railway-station, four miles from the point where the
timing commenced. But fast as we had travelled,
Mannering travelled faster. When we reached Bagshot
we learned he was half a minute ahead.</p>

<p>We flew through the lovely pine country on the
wings of the wind, through Hook, and so into Basingstoke.
By this time we were covered from head to foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with white dust, looking more like working masons than
anything else; but wherever we went, I knew Forrest
had the power to make the way easy. If he had been
anybody else but a detective from Scotland Yard, we
should never have got through Basingstoke, for there the
police, warned in some manner of our approach, had
drawn a huge waggon across the road, thus completely
barring our progress. It was soon drawn aside when
Forrest produced his badge, and once more we flew
westwards. So through Whitchurch and Andover.</p>

<p>How we succeeded in escaping accidents I cannot
explain. Providence seemed to watch over both pursuers
and pursued. We were always on the verge of a collision
with somebody or something. Cottages, carts, pedestrians,
cyclists, seemed to be flying by in a never-ending procession.
Yet we touched nothing.</p>

<p>Once past Andover the road became clearer, for
instead of turning towards Salisbury, as I expected, the
Pirate chose the road through Amesbury and Stonehenge.
We swept over Salisbury Plain at a magnificent pace,
but we did not catch sight of the fugitives, though now
and again a glimpse of a distant dust cloud raised my
hopes momentarily. At Wincanton we learned we were
three minutes behind, and setting my teeth, I determined
I would not slacken speed again until we overtook the
fugitives or reached Exeter. The road was admirable
hereabouts, and we ran so steadily that, but for the
hedges flying past, we might have been sitting in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>armchairs. After Ilminster the road became steeper,
though it was yet too early in the year to be very
rough.</p>

<p>But how is it possible to describe a journey at the
pace we were making? Our progress became dream-like
to me. It was almost monotonous. One could observe
so little, just an incident here and there to mark the
stages in the journey. Thus I remember Honiton by
the frightened scream of a cur which was swept off its
feet by the rush of the air as we passed close at his tail.
Then nothing of note until we reached Exeter.</p>

<p>At the cathedral city we were told the white car was
only a minute in advance. I began to wonder where
the chase was going to end, for Mannering was still
going westward without pause. Still we followed. Out
on to the Launceston road; onward, ever onward until
the bare hills of Dartmoor frowned upon us, and we had
to slacken slightly for the long upward grind. Fortunately
the hills were free from mist, and on reaching
the summit of Whiddon Down we caught once more
a glimpse of the white car before it disappeared in the
distance. I was getting reckless, and I took the descent
at a pace which blanched even Forrest's cheek. Then
through a streak of white houses, which I fancied must
be Okehampton. There was no need to inquire the
way. At the pace both cars were travelling there was
only one road which would serve either Mannering or
myself. In fifteen minutes Launceston came into view.
Then up again until from the top of Bodmin moor we
caught fleeting glimpses of the sea on either side of us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
On still without pause, through Redruth and Camborne
and Hayle. Finally a sight of them at last, as we opened
up St. Michael's Bay as we came to Marazion. And
here I thought the chase had come to an end. I was
mistaken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>SAVED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My</span> brain reeled as we rushed along the road into
Penzance. My forehead seemed to be encircled with
a band of steel. My mouth was so parched that my
tongue rattled against my palate as I tried to speak to
Forrest. My fingers were so cramped with the grip on
the steering wheel, a grip which had never once been
relaxed during our five hours' run, that I could not
relinquish my hold. The road became dark, and involuntarily
I cut off the supply of the gas to the motor
and brought the car to a standstill.</div>

<p>"Go on, man! Go on!" shouted Forrest in my ear.</p>

<p>I could only gasp for answer. I felt suddenly sick.</p>

<p>Then Forrest gave proof of his ready common sense.
He thrust his hand into his pocket and produced the
bottle of champagne which had been left over from our
lunch, and which he had thoughtfully brought with him
in view of some such eventuality as this. Tearing off
the wire he cut the string. The cork flew out and the
liquor creamed from the neck of the bottle. Pushing up
my mask with one hand he held the bottle to my lips
with the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>I spluttered. I choked. But I drank and I drank
again. Never surely was champagne more grateful or
more useful. My strength returned to me instantaneously.
My brain cleared. My eyes saw. My hope returned.
I drew a deep sigh of relief. Forrest handed me the
bottle again.</p>

<p>"After you," I said.</p>

<p>He took a drink and then remarked authoritatively,
"Finish the bottle."</p>

<p>I obeyed and, draining it, tossed it into the hedge
and once more set the car in motion. If our progress
had been speedy before, when we were once through
Penzance, it became absolutely reckless.</p>

<p>My brain was dancing from the effect of the
champagne, and a wild exhilaration throbbed in every
artery. The pace was tremendous, and we had not left
Penzance a couple of miles behind us before the fugitives
came once more into view. Now for the first time I
could see that we were holding our own in the race. It
may have been that some bearing had become heated in
the car Mannering was driving, for undoubtedly his new
car was more speedy than the old, but it was clear that
he could no longer leave us as he had been able to do in
the earlier part of the chase. If only I could increase
ever so slightly the speed of my car, I felt confident of
overtaking him. I motioned to Forrest to bend towards
me, and when his ear was level with my mouth, I asked
him to throw everything which could be got rid of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>overboard, in order to lighten the car. He took my
meaning at once, and away went the cushions and
rugs. The difference was slight, but still there was
a perceptible difference. At the pace we were now
travelling the car rocked from side to side of the road,
and Forrest had to brace himself stiffly against the foot-board
to prevent himself being thrown out. But we
were gaining foot by foot on the fugitives. I felt a thrill
of delight when, on reaching the brow of a hill, I saw the
white car only two hundred yards ahead, and reckoned
that in a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'couples'">couple</ins> of minutes we should have overtaken
them.</p>

<p>But one thing I had overlooked. I became conscious
that we should soon be at the end of our journey, for
suddenly I saw the sea on the horizon. I knew now
where we were, knew that the end was in sight. For
Mannering there could be no return, and I shouted aloud
with exultation when I realized it. We drew closer to
him, so close that I fancied I could see his eyes glittering
through the mica plate of his mask as he turned to look
at us.</p>

<p>A sudden horror gripped me by the throat. He
surely must know as well as myself that he was near the
spot where all roads ended; that we were barely a mile
or two from Land's End. What if he intended to end
his life and his journey together? And what if, not
content with destroying himself, he were to carry with
him to destruction the girl who rode beside him on his
car?</p>

<p>We reached within twenty yards of him, and then as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
if in answer to my thought, I heard him emit a screech
of laughter as his car suddenly shot away from us, and in
half a minute placed him at least a quarter of a mile
ahead. The bitterness of that moment, as my hope died
within me, I can never forget. I only continued the
pursuit mechanically.</p>

<p>We thundered through Sennen without pause and
so onward until we opened up the hotel and the stretch
of green on the brow of the cliff. Then I could have
shrieked with delight. The white car was standing still
and Mannering had left his seat and was standing by the
side. Ten seconds would have brought us to him. Five
passed. He leaped again to his seat, and as he did so,
the white robed figure sprang from the car to the turf.
The Pirate gave a cry of baffled rage. But he had no
time to waste in recovering his escaping victim, for we
were within fifty yards of him. His car leaped forward
and, leaving the road, tossed like a boat at sea over the
uneven boulder-strewn turf. We were within five yards
of him, and it was as much as we could manage to do to
keep our seats.</p>

<p>Just in time I realized the danger into which we
were being unwittingly drawn, and reversing the gear, I
put on both breaks. I was in time, but only just in
time, for we were on a treacherous grassy slope and in
spite of the breaks our car continued to glide forward
under the impulse of the velocity it had attained.</p>

<p>"Jump for your life!" shouted Forrest.</p>

<p>I had wit enough to obey without hesitation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>As I leaped, my eyes were fixed upon Mannering
who at that moment had reached the very edge of the
cliff. I saw him disappear, and then I rolled over on the
turf. I was unhurt, and gathering myself together, I
regained my feet just as the car which had carried us so
well followed the maker over the cliff. A dozen paces
took me to the spot. I shuddered as I glanced downwards
and saw the fate I had escaped. Two or three
hundred feet below the tide was boiling over the jagged
rocks. I fancied I could discern a few fragments of the
white car and that was all.</p>

<p>Not ten seconds before I had seen Mannering wave
his hand at us mockingly as he rode to his death, and
I guessed that his intention had been to lure us on to
a common destruction. Once again he had disappeared,
but now I knew it was for all time.</p>

<p>A strange calm came upon me. Straight in front of
us the Longships lighthouse made a pillar of black marble
against the huge red disc of the setting sun. In the far
distance the Cassiterides floated cloud-like on the horizon.
I gulped down a sob of thankfulness, for the memory
came upon me that the one whom I loved had been
saved by the merest chance from sharing the fate of the
madman who had so unhesitatingly rushed upon his
doom.</p>

<p>I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was Forrest.</p>

<p>"Our work is done," he said, and with an impatient
sigh, he took from his pocket the useless handcuffs and
hurled them after the cars. "One thing we have to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
thankful for," he continued, "thank God, Miss Maitland
is safe."</p>

<p>For reply, I could only grasp his hands and wring
them silently. As I did so, I became conscious that a
number of excited people had gathered about us.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where is she?" I gasped.</p>

<p>Some one pointed to the hotel a hundred yards or so
distant, and Forrest and I hurried towards it. I was a
prey to the most horrible anxiety. I dreaded to contemplate
what the result upon the mind of my darling
might be. I had nearly reached the hotel door, when I
saw a slight figure step across the threshold and shade her
eyes with her hand. With a cry of delight I sprang
forward.</p>

<p>The next moment Evie was in my arms.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That is the story of the Motor Pirate. There remain
but a few things to say. And first of them, let
me explain how it happened that Evie managed to fall
into the Pirate's clutches.</p>

<p>I told her later that it was owing to feminine curiosity.
She, on the other hand, declares it was entirely owing to
her anxiety on my account. Whichever was the reason,
the moment she had heard Mannering's car approach,
she had gone to the garden-gate, whence she was able
to command a view of the coach-house door. She had
seen the man Laver rush forward at the sound of the
whistle. Then the pistol shot rang out, and the next
moment Mannering had appeared on the new car. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
had seen her, and she had attempted to fly to the house,
but he had overtaken her and carried her off. Once on
the car he had proceeded a short distance on the St.
Alban's road, and then stopped to speak to her, for the
first and only time on that day.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you for a ride with me, Miss
Maitland," he had observed. "I merely wish to warn
you before we start, that at the pace we shall travel, you
will find any attempt to escape exceedingly dangerous."</p>

<p>It was then from his manner and appearance she had
realized that she was in the power of a madman.</p>

<p>As regards the ride, she could tell me very little. The
pace was so great that, being unprovided with a mask,
she was obliged to crouch down on the seat and cover
her face with a rug as a protection against the dust. It
seemed an interminable time, she said, and the moment
the car stopped she made an attempt to regain her
liberty, without knowing how near she was to destruction
at the time she made it.</p>

<p>Fortunately the strain had been much less than I
expected, so far as Evie was concerned, and much more
than I anticipated, was its effect upon myself. It was a
long time before I completely recovered from the effects
of those three adventurous days. And the worst of it
was, that everything combined to prevent me obtaining
the absolute quiet which I needed. After spending a
night at the hotel I, of course, hastened to take train to
London in order to restore Evie to her father. But when
I arrived at my place at St. Albans, I found a veritable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
army of pressmen encamped on my doorstep. They
would not give me a moment's peace. I was compelled
to remain in bed, and upon sending a message over to
Evie to inform her of my predicament, she informed me
that she was similarly besieged.</p>

<p>We exchanged a dozen notes. I rose when it was
dark, and slipped out of my back door. I could only see
one method of securing quiet. Even a hardened pressman
has a dislike to intrude upon the privacy of a newly
married couple, so the next morning Evie and Colonel
Maitland joined me in town, and we were married by
special license and, without returning to St. Albans, we
started for my home in Norfolk.</p>

<p>So much for myself.</p>

<p>Forrest was for a long time inconsolable at the final
escape of the Pirate from the hands of justice. So was
his subordinate, Laver, whose sentiments on the subject
are quite too lurid for publication.</p>

<p>As for Mannering, no trace of his body was ever
found, though I have since heard that certain portions of
the cars have been fished up from the pools amongst the
rocks at the base of the cliffs at low tide. At present,
however, there has not been sufficient of the machinery
recovered to enable any one to construct a similar motor.
He had apparently made no drawings, or else had
destroyed them when they had served his turn, so it
would seem as if the secret of the singularly speedy motor
he invented is destined to be lost to the world. Still, it
may be that sufficient will be recovered to give some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
skilled mechanician sufficient guidance to enable him to
reproduce the lost pirate car. If not, well, I don't
suppose it matters. Some one else will be sure to invent
something similar. In fact, from the hints Mannering
gave me, and owing to the opportunity I had of examining
the car in his workshop, I think it is not unlikely that
I shall shortly be applying for letters patent myself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>REVELATIONS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> remains only one thing more. I feel that the story
would be incomplete if I kept to myself certain particulars
concerning Mannering, which have come to my knowledge
since the day when he made his sensational flight into
eternity from the brow of the cliff at Land's End. At
the time, both my wife and myself wished never to hear
again the name of the man whose actions had provided
us with such terrible and nerve-shattering experiences,
but afterwards, when we came to think over the matter,
it occurred to both of us that in fact we knew very little
about the man who had nearly wrecked our lives. To
dwell upon that thought naturally awakened our curiosity
concerning his past life, and, needless to say, when the
opportunity occurred for gratifying our curiosity, we did
not for a moment hesitate about accepting it. It is true
that we had gathered from his conversation that he had
travelled widely, but in what capacity, or with what
object, we knew as little as we knew of his birthplace or
parentage. We found, too, a difficulty in understanding
the motives which had prompted Mannering's actions,
and, though we often discussed the question, we could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
never of ourselves have arrived at a satisfactory solution
of the problem.</div>

<p>On this latter point I must mention the conclusion
arrived at by <i>The Speaker</i>. This sober-minded and extremely
British review declared that his animating motive
was "the strong rock of equity, or abstract justice," inasmuch
as, by principally directing his attention to motorists,
he was avenging <i>The Speaker's</i> quarrel with a class
which this journal held in particular abhorrence. Naturally,
both Evie and myself smiled at the thought that the
Motor Pirate was a conservative gentleman, anxious only
to restore to the highways of England something of their
pristine calm. For myself, I inclined to the belief that he
was a remarkable specimen of the megalomaniac, whose
exploits were prompted much more by the desire for
notoriety than by any altruistic motive, or even by any
sordid consideration regarding the plunder which he
secured. Certainly had he been a mere criminal, impelled
by the desire for the easy acquisition of wealth, he could
have pursued his career for a much longer period than he
actually did. As for my wife, with a woman's natural
tendency to read a romance into any and every development
of human activity, she held fast to the opinion that the
Pirate's extraordinary career was the outcome of an overmastering
passion for herself. The probability is, that in
his brain all these motives operated at different times.
The natural love of plunder, inherent in the criminal
mind, is as often as not accompanied by a morbid delight
in awakening the wonder of the public by the performance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of startling deeds and, in the same temperament, it is not
unusual to discover the romantic nature developed to a
considerable degree. But, from the data at our command,
I fancy it would have been impossible even for the experienced
psychologist to decide which, so to speak, was
the master impulse.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the few facts concerning him, which
came into our possession afterwards, tend to clear up these
points to some degree. Certainly they left me with a
clearer light upon his individuality.</p>

<p>To these facts I am indebted to Inspector Forrest, who,
some six months after our famous ride together in pursuit
of the pirate, managed to find time to pay a flying
visit to our Norfolk home, where we had continued to
dwell in peaceful seclusion.</p>

<p>It was at dinner, on the night of his arrival, that Forrest
first hinted that he had picked up some details of
Mannering's life-history, and of course nothing would
content Evie but a promise that we should hear what he
had discovered. So, directly the meal was finished, we
adjourned for our coffee and cigars to my sanctum, where,
in front of a comfortable fire, Forrest made no difficulty
about satisfying our curiosity.</p>

<p>"You see," he began, when his cigar was once well
alight, "I was every bit as curious as Mrs. Sutgrove."</p>

<p>"Or myself," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Or Mr. Sutgrove," said the detective, smiling, "for
there is precious little difference between the sexes so far
as curiosity is concerned, in spite of the generally accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
opinion on the matter. But being curious, I naturally
made the most minute search when I searched his place
at St. Alban's. I didn't find much there, it is true, but
I did secure a clue which ultimately led me to some lodgings
which he had occupied some three or four years
previously, and there, by the merest good luck, I discovered
that when he had departed he had left behind him
a worn-out travelling-bag, and in that bag was a bundle
of papers which supplied me with sufficient information
to reconstruct his history to some extent, though I should
not like to swear to the absolute accuracy of every detail
of his biography as I see it."</p>

<p>"Was there nothing at all found at St. Alban's then?"
asked Evie.</p>

<p>"I fancy you must have seen in the papers a pretty full
account of all that the police discovered there?" said the
detective.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Evie. "We read a lot of stories, but
they varied to such an extent that we really did not know
what to believe."</p>

<p>Forrest smiled. "Now I come to think of it, the reporters
did give their imaginations free reins, but you
can take it from me that, with the exception of the plunder
he amassed after his return from that Continental trip,
and the apparatus for the production of the liquid hydrogen,
there was very little in his house of interest to me
or you. There was his bank-book, and some correspondence
with a learned professor at the Royal Institution.
I followed up both clues. At the R. I. I discovered nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Mannering had merely posed as a wealthy amateur
in chemistry, and of course he met with every assistance
when he had asked for help in following up his researches
into the behaviour of liquid gases. At his bank also, very
little was known about him. When he had come to St.
Alban's he had opened an account by a payment into it
of six or seven thousand pounds in Bank of England notes.
He had drawn steadily upon the account until it was
nearly exhausted, and, in point of fact, there was only a
few pounds to his credit from the time when he commenced
his career on the road, until a week or two after
his return from Amsterdam, when he paid in two thousand
pounds in gold, and a fortnight later swelled his balance
with a similar amount."</p>

<p>"That was the proceeds of the Brighton mail robbery,"
I remarked.</p>

<p>Forrest nodded. "That was his only really big coup.
As for his other plunder, he probably disposed of the
proceeds of all his early cruises on the Continent, at the
same time that he sold the diamonds. That which he
obtained afterwards was found intact in the safe in his
bedroom. Heavens! What an opportunity I missed by
not taking out a search-warrant for his house. When we
paid our midnight visit, there must have been ample evidence
behind the steel door to have convicted him."</p>

<p>The detective was silent for awhile, and bit savagely
at his cigar.</p>

<p>"He was not a wealthy man, then," I remarked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Forrest. "There was no trace of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
owning any property anywhere, and his expenditure on
the gas plant and on his motors&mdash;we found that the
various parts had been made to specification at a variety
of works in England and abroad&mdash;had eaten heavily into
his capital, so that at the time of the commencement of his
career he must have been very nearly penniless. Whether
he built the motor with the idea of utilizing it for the
purpose he ultimately put it to, of course I cannot say,
but I have a shrewd suspicion that he really did design
it for the purpose, since from what I have learned of
him the predatory instinct must have been pretty strongly
developed in him."</p>

<p>The detective paused for a minute, and, flicking the ash
off his cigar, gazed meditatively into the fire.</p>

<p>"You shall judge for yourselves," he continued. "Unfortunately,
I cannot begin right at the beginning, for I
do not know where he was born, nor who his parents
were. I can only guess at these facts from the knowledge
that, as a boy, he was at school in the south of England,
and that then his name was Ram Krishna Roy."</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, in amazement. "A Hindu?"</p>

<p>"An Eurasian, I should fancy," replied Forrest. "He
had been sent to school in England by one of those petty
Indian princes, who still exercise sovereignty under
British suzerainty."</p>

<p>"How did you discover that?" asked Evie.</p>

<p>"It was like this, Mrs. Sutgrove," replied Forrest.
"Amongst the papers I spoke about as being in the old
portmanteau, were a number of letters written in characters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
I could not understand. I could see they were
oriental, and that was as much as I could make of them,
so I took them to a noted oriental scholar who translated
them for me. The language was Urdu, and the writer
was a munshi, who was obviously communicating with
an old pupil. There were so many references to scenes
with which the person to whom the letters were addressed,
as well as the writer, was familiar, that it was quite clear
that the former must have been brought up amidst purely
native surroundings. There were one or two more obscure
allusions which led me to conclude that the boy's
mother must have been a white woman, and from what we
saw of him there can be no doubt but that he was white
on one side."</p>

<p>"Nobody would have taken him to be aught but an
Englishman," murmured Evie.</p>

<p>"No," said Forrest. "I was intensely surprised when
I discovered these proofs of his identity and at first I
thought they could not apply to him, but before I come
to the connecting link, let me mention one curious thing
in the letters, which may do something to explain the
curious influence which Mannering exerted over Mrs.
Sutgrove."</p>

<p>"He hypnotized me, I am sure," declared Evie,
decidedly.</p>

<p>"Very possibly," replied the detective. "In nearly
every letter was to be found an admonition to the effect&mdash;I
cannot give you a verbatim translation&mdash;that the
writer hoped his old pupil would not forget that to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
was entrusted the secret power of Siva, which would, by
practice, enable him to mould all men to his will."</p>

<p>"If he had possessed that," I interrupted, "there would
have been no necessity for him to have practised piracy
on the high-road."</p>

<p>"True," said Forrest. "But it is quite possible that
Mrs. Sutgrove's conjecture is correct, and that even at
that early age Mannering had learnt something about
hypnotism from his native instructor, for I am very certain
that of these semi-occult sciences, the East has much
more precise knowledge than is realized by the Western
world."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said my wife, shuddering slightly at the
remembrance. "He certainly had a most singular power
over me."</p>

<p>"He probably increased his knowledge when he returned
to his native land, which, I gathered, must have
taken place when he was about seventeen. Then there
is a break for nearly ten years in his history."</p>

<p>"I don't quite see how you connect Ram Krishna Roy
with Mannering," I interpolated.</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that," replied Forrest. "With these
letters was another in its original envelope addressed in
the same hand to Julian Mannering at San Francisco.
It was the most interesting letter of the lot. It was full
of reproaches addressed to the dear pupil, who had cut
himself off from the asceticism of the East, and devoted
himself to the gross materialism of Western civilization.
It concluded by the expression of an intention to once more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
attempt to persuade him to return by a personal appeal.
On the back of the letter was a note in Mannering's handwriting.
'Old Chatterji kept his promise. I had quite
a long conversation with him in the ballroom last night.
Everybody thought I was drunk or mad to be talking
Hindustani, apparently to empty air. However, that's the
last of him. I've done with the East.'".</p>

<p>"You make him more a man of mystery than ever," I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I can't help it," said Forrest. "Perhaps his old tutor
really did appear to him. Perhaps Mannering was mad.
Who knows? Both are dead. However, he seems to
have carried out his intention of not returning to India.
Ram Krishna Roy disappeared from that time forth, and
Julian Mannering took his place. He seems to have been
doing nothing at San Francisco at the time, but a little
later he appears to have accepted an appointment as
engineer to a mine in Arizona. He left the berth suddenly
a few months later, owing to some trouble about
the wife of one of the miners. The miner was shot, and
his comrades were so incensed that Mannering had to
depart hot-foot. Then for awhile I can only guess at his
occupation from some newspaper cuttings which he had
preserved. These point to his identification with the
leader of a gang of desperadoes whose most notable
exploit was the successful holding up of a train which had
a considerable quantity of specie on board."</p>

<p>"I remember him describing the affair," said Evie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
"though he represented himself as on the side of the
attacked."</p>

<p>"The only assistance he gave to the plundered was to
assist them to a better land by the aid of his gun. He
escaped, though, and made his way to Australia, and
once again he resumed the practice of his profession,&mdash;mining
engineering. For three or four years he was engaged
at a newly-opened mine in the northern territory
of West Australia. But instinct was too strong for him.
He must really have had a strong dash of the blood of
some of those Indian hill-tribe freebooters in his veins,
for he never seems to have been able to resist the prospect
of plunder, and the likelihood of having to fight for it
seems to have been an additional inducement. Thus, at
the mine, under his charge, it was the custom to send,
periodically, the gold extracted, under a strong escort,
to the nearest town, some forty miles distant. For a long
time these consignments were delivered with perfect
safety. Then, after a particularly rich vein had been
struck, it became necessary to forward a very large consignment
of bullion. Contrary to the usual practice, only
two men were sent in charge of it. Their dead bodies
were afterwards discovered, and the gold was never recovered.
No one seems to have had the least suspicion
that the gentlemanly engineer at the mine was likely to
have had something to do with the business, and when,
shortly afterward, he resigned his post and took a passage
to Europe, he received the highest possible testimonials
from his manager and directors. I have no doubt, myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that he was the prime mover in the robbery, for his salary
was a small one, and directly afterwards he spent six
months in Paris, where his expenditure would have been
lavish for a millionaire."</p>

<p>"That was where my father met him," remarked Evie.
"I remember him expressing surprise at the simplicity
of Mannering's life at St. Alban's in view of the luxury
with which he had been surrounded when they had met
previously."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the detective. "But his Paris career
ended as it had commenced. He disappeared suddenly,
without a word of farewell to any of his acquaintance,
and had it not been for one bit of evidence, I should have
had not the slightest idea as to what he had been doing
with himself in the interval between that time and his
arrival at St. Alban's. You may remember that a scientific
expedition was despatched by the Dutch government about
six years ago to make some investigations in the interior
of New Guinea?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"It started six months after Mannering disappeared
from Paris, and from the time it left Batavia <i>en route</i>
for New Guinea not a word has ever been heard of it."</p>

<p>"You cannot mean to infer that Mannering had anything
to do with that?" I asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>"I infer nothing," replied Forrest. "But I do know
that a pocketbook, which had belonged to a chemist
attached to the exploring party, was one of the documents
I found in his bag. The book contained a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
notes upon the liquefaction of gases, and these may
very likely have first interested Mannering in the subject.
As I have since discovered from a search of the registers
at Lloyds that there were quite a number of ships lost
about the same time in those seas, I cannot help thinking
that our friend had served an apprenticeship under
the black flag at sea before taking to land piracy."</p>

<p>"At that rate he must have been the greatest criminal
on earth," I declared.</p>

<p>"He was certainly the biggest I ever came across,"
replied Forrest, "and my only regret is that I was unable
to secure him in order that he might have judicially
paid the penalty for his crimes."</p>

<p>"It was a pity," I said, "though I fancy if we had
trapped him he would have found some means of cheating
the gallows and making a melodramatic exit from the
world."</p>

<p>"It is more than likely," said Forrest. "He was not
the ordinary type of criminal. I was speaking to a big
mental specialist the other day, and&mdash;but I had better
complete the story of his career first. Where did we
leave him?"</p>

<p>"New Guinea," I prompted.</p>

<p>"The only other reason I have for suspecting him of
being engaged in deeds of violence in that quarter of the
globe is that he returned to England <i>via</i> Singapore, with
a considerable quantity of bullion in his possession. The
rest of his history you know."</p>

<p>"He seems to have had a stirring existence, anyhow,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
I commented. "And one hardly sees any reason for
it save natural sin."</p>

<p>"The alienist I was talking to the other day described
him as a moral pervert. He said he was a type of
insanity usually associated with physical incapacity or
a low order of intelligence, but when, as in Mannering's
case, both physique and intelligence were above the
average, the moral pervert is a greater danger to the
community than an army of ordinary criminals. If ever
I said a prayer it would be when a madman of that type
was removed from the world."</p>

<p>"Amen," said both Evie and I, heartily.</p>
